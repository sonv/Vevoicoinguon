= 15. Administrative Transfer and the Takeover of Hải Phòng

According to the Geneva Agreement, after the takeover of Hà Nội and Hải Dương, the final stage was the takeover of the 300-day zone, including the port city of Hải Phòng.
The takeover of the 300-day zone and Hải Phòng carried significant meaning.
As Hồ Chủ tịch once wrote: in the past we had only the night, now we have the day; before we had mountains and forests, now we have the sea.

After completing my assignment for the takeover of Hải Dương, I thought I would finally return to the responsibilities assigned to me in Thành ủy Hà Nội.
Unexpectedly, I received instructions from the Ban Bí thư to continue working with the Uỷ ban Liên hiệp đình chiến trung ương on preparations for the takeover of the 300-day zone and the city of Hải Phòng.

The Uỷ ban Liên hiệp đình chiến headquarters had already moved from Phủ Lỗ to the area below Phú Thái railway station on the Hà Nội–Hải Phòng line.
The Vietnamese delegation was headed by Văn Tiến Dũng.
The French delegation was led by General De Brébisson.

Throughout the resistance war against the French, I had worked in Hà Nội, so I was familiar with the situation and the work there.
As for Hải Phòng, I only had a few childhood memories, and later learned more through friends, but I did not truly understand the city in depth.

At this time, reports from the local Đảng bộ to our delegation at the Uỷ ban Liên hiệp đình chiến indicated that the French side was trying to move office property and government assets to the South; even some property belonging to Hà Nội was still being held at Hải Phòng Port.
These actions violated the Geneva Agreement.
If the struggle over the transfer of Hải Phòng was handled well, it would benefit not only Hải Phòng but also Hà Nội.

Following the Central Committee’s instructions, the steering committee for the struggle and takeover of the 300-day zone and Hải Phòng was chaired by Đỗ Mười, Bí thư Khu ủy Tả Ngạn.
He summoned me, along with Nguyễn Khai.
Under his assignment, I was responsible for the negotiations at the Uỷ ban Liên hiệp đình chiến in order to reach an agreement on the administrative transfer of Hải Phòng, as had been achieved in Hà Nội.

At that time, the Khu ủy Tả Ngạn was based in Hải Dương.
The Standing Committee of Thành ủy Hải Phòng was located south of Phú Lương Bridge.
I met with Hoàng Mậu, Trần Kiên, and Tô Duy to discuss Hải Phòng’s situation, and also worked with Khu Công an to help form Công an Hải Phòng.

Each day, I and several comrades who had experience drafting the administrative transfer agreement for Hà Nội went to the Uỷ ban Liên hiệp đình chiến headquarters to work with the French on the new document.

When preparing for Hà Nội, the French had sent a legal adviser from their Embassy in Sài Gòn to negotiate with me, and later even added a technical adviser from the French Embassy in the United States.
They all said that nowhere in the world had warring parties ever peacefully handed over cities to each other, as stipulated in the Geneva Agreement.

But for Hải Phòng, perhaps believing they now had experience, they assigned only a lieutenant colonel of the French expeditionary army to represent them.
He came from a noble family, was arrogant by habit, but in fact understood very little and likely just followed orders, making the work unnecessarily complicated.

In the administrative transfer agreement for Hà Nội, after intense struggle, the French had been forced to accept a clause on compensation for removed assets—a development beyond the Geneva Agreement.
For Hải Phòng, this became the most contentious point.
The French refused to recognize the precedent of Hà Nội.
Our side insisted.
All other issues were settled; only this point was deadlocked.

One day, the head of the French delegation asked Văn Tiến Dũng for permission for De Bresson—the same person who had negotiated with me about Hà Nội—to meet privately with me to discuss the difficulties.
Văn Tiến Dũng agreed.
Bùi Văn Các and I met De Bresson.
It was only an exchange of positions, not a negotiation.
But shortly afterward, the administrative transfer agreement for Hải Phòng was signed.

I reported the results to the steering committee.
Đỗ Mười decided we had to quickly organize the advance administrative teams to take over in the sequence of the French withdrawal—from Móng Cái, then Hồng Gai and Quảng Yên, and only then Hải Phòng; Đồ Sơn being the final point from which the French would depart entirely from the North.

Following the experience of Hà Nội, all departments of Khu Tả Ngạn were responsible for forming the administrative apparatus in Hải Phòng, from which selected personnel would be placed in the advance teams.

At the same time, under a decision of the Ban Bí thư Trung ương Đảng, a new Thành ủy of Hải Phòng was formed, along with the Uỷ ban quân quản and Uỷ ban Hành chính Hải Phòng.
Central-level cadres assisting with the takeover included Lý Ban, Hoàng Sâm, and myself, who was also appointed to the new Thành ủy.

At a meeting point in Đông Triều district—with Đỗ Mười present—I briefed several comrades of the former Hồng Quảng region on the content of the administrative transfer agreement for the 300-day zone, highlighting points requiring strong struggle and methods that would ensure the greatest advantage for us.

After that, together with Hoàng Mậu and Tô Duy in Hải Dương, we formed the advance administrative teams for Hải Phòng.
The members were fully briefed on the agreement, on the key issues specific to Hải Phòng, and on how to rely on local workers and staff to ensure solid, documented handovers at every office.

According to the agreement, the advance teams would enter Hải Phòng ten days before the official takeover.
To ensure local familiarity, Đỗ Mười assigned Hoàng Mậu, Tô Duy, and me as the leadership group for the advance teams, with me as the head.
Tô Duy went in advance to choose a place for the teams to stay.

To house about one hundred people and keep them separate from the population, the French assigned the old Bouet military camp near the port, now empty, for our accommodation.

To move all personnel into Hải Phòng, many trucks were needed.
We had recently received several large and well-made buses from Czechoslovakia, and we decided that specialized staff would ride in the trucks, while the Czech buses would carry the kitchen workers with their pots, pans, and baskets.
We wanted the people of the city to see that under our system, ordinary laborers were respected.
Indeed, when the convoy entered Hải Phòng, crowds poured out to watch and talked excitedly.

During the Hà Nội takeover, our advance teams had stayed inside Đồn Thủy hospital (now Military Hospital 108), where we used the telephone system to coordinate.
In Hải Phòng, the French—citing security—demanded escorts for any movement and provided no telephone connections in the old camp.
Each team had to manage its own work on the ground.
Fortunately, we were well prepared from the Hà Nội experience, so the teams knew how to struggle effectively, rely on local staff, prepare thorough handover minutes, list missing assets, and force the opposing officers to sign.
In this, the contributions of local unions were significant.

On 13 May 1955, our army entered the city.
Along with other civilian sectors, they took over the offices and institutions where our advance teams were already waiting.

By noon, our forces and civilian personnel had completed the takeover of Hải Phòng.
The last French units withdrew through Đồ Sơn and departed by the military port.

The North of our country was completely free of colonial forces.

The entire city seemed to glow with the red flag bearing the gold star.
For countless people, a new life was beginning.
The revolution of our entire nation had entered a new phase.

The return of the beloved children of the largest port city in the North had become a reality.
After so many difficult years—from Đèo Voi to the enemy’s rear areas in Tả Ngạn, and for some, clinging to life inside the occupied city—their faith and love for Thành Tô had sustained them, and now they stood on the streets of Hải Phòng as victors.
