= 19. Heaven’s net and earth’s snare against commando-spies

After openly sabotaging the 1954 Hiệp định Genève, Ngô Đình Diệm rejected a general election to unify the country by peaceful means.
He then spoke aggressively about filling the Bến Hải River and marching North.

But contradictions inside the enemy camp in the South continued to grow.
Even after Diệm eliminated the opposing religious sects, there was the incident of a ngụy pilot bombing Dinh Độc Lập, followed by the failed coup of 1960.

During this period, the Mặt trận Dân tộc giải phóng miền Nam Việt Nam was formed.
Its appearance pushed divisions in the enemy ranks even further.

To regain some initiative, the Mỹ–ngụy authorities decided to send commando-spies into the North.
The first groups parachuted in around 1960.
One notable point was that they did not keep the operation secret, but announced it openly.

When Công an and local people in several areas captured these commando-spies, they found that most were former ngụy soldiers or reactionaries.
Their hometowns were in those very places.
They had followed the enemy to the South in 1954, and were now recruited, trained, and sent back to operate as intelligence agents and saboteurs — especially to set up bases among people on the spot.

The Ban Bí thư Trung ương Đảng received reports on the situation.
It then directed the Đảng đoàn Bộ Công an to devise a comprehensive response to the enemy’s schemes, both immediate and long-term.
For the commando-spies in particular, the instruction was to raise vigilance and launch a broad public movement to prevent and combat them — whether they arrived by parachute, by sea, or by land.

$ * * * $

Following that direction, the Đảng đoàn Bộ Công an served as the core force assisting the Ban Bí thư.
They issued guidance to Party committees, local authorities, and related sectors, and organized many conferences to share experiences from successful captures.
They also publicized the enemy’s espionage methods, based on the confessions of those arrested.

Trials of commando-spy cases, when held publicly, were widely reported.
This helped raise vigilance and mobilize the public, while striking at the morale of the commando-spies the enemy intended to send.
At the same time, the State’s leniency policy was publicized for those who surrendered or rendered meritorious service.

In areas where enemy infiltration was likely, detailed plans were made for close coordination among forces — especially between Công an and the xã, bản militia.
These plans covered both preventive measures and the pursuit of commando-spies once they appeared.
Many places held practice drills.

Families whose relatives had once been ngụy soldiers, ngụy officials, or reactionaries who had followed the enemy to the South were informed clearly of the State’s policies.
If any commando-spies came to make contact, they could advise them to surrender or report immediately to Công an.

Because of this careful preparation, after the first few cases when we were caught off guard, we were later able to take the initiative.
People had become highly alert.
Seeing a stranger in the area, anyone would find a way to notify Công an or the local militia at once.
This was a crucial factor — one the enemy never anticipated.
Since Công an and the militia understood the terrain well, the pursuit of commando-spies was usually quick and orderly.

A few cases may be mentioned.

Enemy aircraft were shot down in Ninh Bình as they entered inland from the sea.
Several spies died; the survivors were captured along with their equipment.
Although their map had burned, what remained was enough to prove that this flight was meant to drop commandos by parachute into a northern location.
The case was tried publicly in Hà Nội.

Another case involved underwater commandos infiltrating the coast of Quảng Bình.
They planned to plant mines to destroy our Navy’s ships at Sông Gianh port.
They were captured with full evidence.
This case, too, was tried publicly in Quảng Bình.

The case of several commando-spies secretly landing on the central coast to make contact with bases in the old Khu 4 was also notable.
Some of them even had the task of reaching Hà Nội.
Because of our operational measures, combined with the help of local people, Công an quickly detected them.

One of them used forged papers issued by the đặc khu Vĩnh Linh.
He was discovered when he checked in at a small inn in Vinh.
When he reached Hà Nội, he was closely monitored.

Sensing that he had been exposed, he made a rather complicated move — one clearly planned in advance by his commanders.
Taking advantage of the State’s leniency policy for those who voluntarily surrendered, he went straight to Sở Công an to turn himself in, hoping that once things quieted down he could continue his intelligence work.

Knowing this, we needed to expose his deceit.
I had to handle the matter myself, because it could not be done roughly; we needed objective evidence, obtained through proper professional work, to prove his false surrender.

Based on reports from the local area about unusual signs along the Hà Tĩnh coast, we went there to investigate.
Under the sand on the beach, we found maps, personal items, and documents issued by the enemy’s espionage command for him to use when returning to the South.
This strongly suggested that he was indeed the same person who had infiltrated the Hà Tĩnh shore.

To determine objectively that he was the infiltrator, and at the same time reveal his false surrender, we could not simply confront him with the items recovered from the beach.
Professional skill had to be met with professional skill.

At that time, national highway 1 had no bridges as it does today, and passengers had to cross many ferries.
Whenever a passenger bus reached a ferry, everyone had to get off for safety.
According to his initial statement, after crossing the giới tuyến at Vĩnh Linh, he took a passenger bus straight from Vĩnh Linh to Hà Nội — as his forged papers claimed.

To test this, I asked him a question, recording it on tape.
I asked, in essence: “What did you see along the road?”
He answered: “I slept the whole way.”
I asked again: “Was there ever a time when someone woke you up?”
Thinking I was asking about roadside document checks, he immediately replied that no one ever woke him.

But this was clearly untrue.
Traveling from Vĩnh Linh to Hà Nội required crossing the Quán Hầu ferry, the Sông Gianh ferry, the Bến Thủy ferry, the Ghép ferry, the Hàm Rồng ferry, and more.

I then had him write a full statement and certify that he bore responsibility if any part was false.
After that, I pointed out to him that he had lied, and therefore was no longer eligible for the leniency policy for those who truly surrendered.

Faced with this, he confessed.
His statement matched the evidence we had recovered from the Hà Tĩnh beach.
When he reached quốc lộ 1, he had hitched a ride on a truck to Vinh.
There he was detected.
This case was later tried in Hà Nội.

There was also a humorous detail.
When we returned to the Hà Tĩnh coast and spoke with the local residents, the trưởng Công an xóm confirmed that on that day he had been slaughtering a duck.
He saw a stranger coming in from the sea, passing his house, and asking for the way to quốc lộ 1.
He simply showed the man the way, without checking any papers.
Had he checked and seen the man carrying documents from Vĩnh Linh, he would have suspected something immediately.

It shows how easy it is to talk about vigilance — and how difficult it is to practice it consistently.

Perhaps the enemy in the South believed that areas with Catholic communities would be safe havens for them.
Once, they sent a spy who was a Catholic, landing by sea, to make contact with a reactionary figure among the all-Catholic population in the old Khu 4.
It was the neighbor of that reactionary who noticed something suspicious and promptly informed Công an.
The spy was caught in the act.
The neighbor was also a Catholic.
Clearly, with or without religious faith, any citizen could have a strong sense of patriotism.

In another incident, the enemy dropped a group of commandos by parachute into Khánh Mậu commune in Ninh Bình — also a Catholic area.
But whether Catholic or non-Catholic, the people there captured the entire group and handed them over to Công an.

The enemy did not know that Khánh Mậu was then the “leading flag” commune of Ninh Bình in the movement for Public Security and Order.

For the mountain regions, the enemy in the South believed it safest to recruit from among the lang đạo who had migrated.
So they dropped a commando team by parachute into an area of Hòa Bình Province, with the team leader belonging to an old quan lang family.
But his family in the locality had always been treated properly and understood the Government’s policies.
When he came to make contact, they advised him to surrender.
He volunteered to make amends.

With the Minister of Public Security’s approval, we allowed him to use his radio to communicate with his commanders in the South.
At that time, our air-defense forces had only recently been formed and were still young.
After discussing the matter with anh Trần Quốc Hoàn — then Minister of Public Security — one day anh Văn Tiến Dũng, then Chief of the General Staff, invited me to a meeting, with anh Phùng Thế Tài, then Commander of Air Defense and also a friend of mine, present.
Anh Văn Tiến Dũng asked the Ministry of Public Security to help the Air Defense Forces train by using this commando case.

I thought of the commando group in Hòa Bình, since the Air Defense Forces were often deployed at dốc Cun.
The plan was simple: the commando group would request an airdrop.
The supply plane would have to fly over dốc Cun on its way to them.
That would give the Air Defense Forces an opportunity to shoot.

Indeed, as expected, one night an enemy plane flew over dốc Cun.
At that time, our troops had only anti-aircraft guns — no missiles — but they hit the plane.
Damaged, the aircraft dropped all its cargo to lighten itself, then sped away, trying to reach the Vĩnh Linh demarcation line.

From experience, enemy planes often flew north to drop commandos on moonlit nights.
So during the bright phases of the moon, everyone watched for night flights.
The technical units of the Ministry of Public Security also had to work very hard.

One evening, the officer on duty reported an unusual signal detected by the technical team.
I immediately sent urgent messages to the provinces of the old Khu 4 to stay alert.
Just a few hours after the message went out, Công an Quảng Bình reported that, acting on the Ministry’s order, they had captured an entire commando team that had parachuted into the mountains of Tuyên Hóa district.
In this case, the Bí thư Tỉnh ủy personally oversaw the efforts of Công an, the Tỉnh đội, and the Dân quân in the pursuit.
Localities came to have great trust in the Ministry’s technical units.

It may be said that air infiltration had become too obvious, so the enemy command shifted to using the sea.
They did not expect that we had already prepared coastal defenses against commando-spies.

One dark night, Công an vũ trang on patrol in Vịnh Hạ Long noticed something strange.
A large sailboat, bigger than the local fishing boats and shaped unlike the boats in this region, appeared.
At that time, we had no motorized boats.
Yet despite a headwind, this vessel was sailing swiftly against the wind.
It was very suspicious.

Our men gave chase.
As soon as they pulled alongside, several of our armed officers, skilled in close combat, jumped aboard and secured the people on the boat.
A search revealed that the vessel carried a powerful engine and was loaded with radio equipment, explosives, and supplies for a commando team intended to infiltrate the Hạ Long Bay area by sea.
This case was later tried publicly in Hồng Quảng Province.

The Kuomintang special agents in Taiwan, supported by the Mỹ–ngụy authorities in the South, also used the sea route.
They sent a commando team to the island of Trà Cổ in Hải Ninh Province, intending to pass through Vietnamese territory to enter the Thập Vạn Đại Sơn region of China near our border.
But the Dân quân, Công an xã, and people of Trà Cổ captured the entire group, led by a Kuomintang special-agent lieutenant colonel.
We handed them over to China for handling, and the Chinese authorities expressed great thanks to our Government and people.

Thanks to the high vigilance of our people, and the readiness and determined spirit of Công an and the local Dân quân, not a single enemy group escaped the “heaven’s net and earth’s snare” laid by our people.

Later, even the Pentagon — the U.S. Department of Defense — admitted in its White Paper that the plan to send commando-spies into North Vietnam in the 1960s had completely failed.

$ * * * $

The achievements of Công an (including Công an nhân dân vũ trang), the Dân quân, and our people from 1960 onward — capturing and eliminating commando-spies regardless of where they came from or how they entered — helped prepare both morale and forces to defeat the air war launched by the United States beginning in August 1964.
They had boasted that they would bomb North Vietnam back to the Stone Age.

Looking back, we are deeply proud of the wise leadership and direction of the Ban Bí thư Trung ương Đảng.
We are proud of the close unity and coordination of our armed forces.
We are proud of the heroic people of Vietnam, who themselves sustained a broad and unprecedented movement to resist commando-spies and gave strong support to the professional security forces to complete their tasks well.

Taking lessons from the past, all our people — as well as the armed forces of our State — continue to heighten vigilance against the enemy’s new schemes and methods aimed at creating “peaceful evolution” in our country.
We are determined to defeat every dark scheme of theirs, to firmly protect the revolutionary State of the people, by the people, for the people, and to safeguard our beloved Vietnam.
