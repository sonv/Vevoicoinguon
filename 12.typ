= 12. Struck by Heaven but Not Killed

During the Resistance against the French, in 1948, I went from Hà Nội up to Việt Bắc to attend the national Công an conference.
From Vĩnh Yên, I followed the foothills of Tam Đảo to reach Sơn Dương district of Tuyên Quang province.
There, I had to stop at a Công an post to report to the Văn phòng Nha Công an trung ương.
I met several comrades from other Khu who were also waiting there.

The Công an post was a small bamboo house roofed with gồi leaves, hidden under a large tree with thick foliage.
That day, it was raining.

I asked to use the post’s telephone to call the Nha Công an trung ương.
The telephone was placed in the innermost corner of the post, on a bamboo table beneath the trunk of the big tree whose leaves covered the entire roof.

Telephones in those days were magneto telephones.
One had to crank a handle to reach the Bưu điện switchboard and have them connect the line.

I was holding the receiver, waiting for the Bưu điện to connect.
Suddenly a loud thunderclap exploded.
Everyone saw a bright green streak of light flash down from the sky and pass through my body.
At the same time, they heard an ear-splitting crack of thunder.

As for me, I was stunned because a burst of light flashed before my eyes, and I heard a violent explosion such as I had never experienced.
The receiver flew out of my hand and fell to the ground.
The telephone set in front of me exploded into pieces.

Then everything fell silent again, like the stillness of the forest.
It was still raining.

People rushed over to see if anything had happened to me.
They told me what they had seen and said everyone thought I had been struck dead on the spot.
When they saw I was still alive, they were astonished.

Afterwards, comrades often joked and called me “the guy struck by Heaven but not killed.”
Many said that meant I would live a long life.

Whether I live long or not has never mattered much to me.
But since I am someone “struck by Heaven but not killed,” I should recount the times I narrowly escaped death, to test the saying.

During the nationwide resistance against the French, at the end of 1947, we were in the Bương Cấn area of Quốc Oai district in Sơn Tây province.
I avoided placing our office near the market and chose instead a small hamlet called Trại Do.
It was a poor hamlet with some Catholics, and there was a small church in the village.

Quốc Oai was an area where houses were built of laterite blocks dug from the soil and dried, then used to build walls with lime mixed with molasses, for in those days cement was scarce.
The earth was red; when it rained, shoes and sandals became caked with mud.
But tea and jackfruit grew very well there.
There were even hamlets named Ao Sen and Đất Đỏ.

Our office was set in a house with a small yard, where a few tea bushes and jackfruit trees grew.
One day, the French attacked phủ Quốc Oai, about ten kilometers from our office.
People returning from the market brought us the news.
But knowing the enemy had only infantry, at that distance we stayed where we were, keeping our papers and belongings neatly packed so that we could move only if they came closer.

By early afternoon we suddenly heard explosions booming at the crossroads on the main road.
At that time we had no experience, and our office had no shelter against shelling.
Hearing the loud blasts, we guessed they were artillery shells.

We spread out and lay down at the base of several jackfruit trees.

Suddenly there was a loud explosion right near our house.
Smoke billowed thick for a while before it cleared.

I was lying at the foot of a jackfruit tree when I felt something brush my left shoulder.
I reached up and found my shirt torn and my skin slightly bleeding.
I looked toward the tree trunk and saw a gouge in the bark.
Lodged there was a small, sharp piece of steel.
It turned out to be a small fragment of an artillery shell.
From that, I realized the fragment had skimmed past my shoulder, struck the trunk, and stuck there.
If it had flown just a little lower, it would have hit me.

Later I learned that the enemy had 105-millimeter guns, which reached much farther than our 81-millimeter mortars.
If the road distance was ten kilometers, the straight-line distance was even shorter.
Our location was within the range of the 105-millimeter artillery.

Around 1948, one noon I was on a work trip passing through Đồng Quan market in Thường Tín district of Hà Đông province.
At that time the place was lively and well known.
There were cafés and ice drinks of all kinds.
There was even a brothel.

I had barely reached the entrance of the market when I heard the sound of enemy aircraft.
Machine-gun fire from the planes swept the market, striking the stalls on both sides of the road.
The earth was torn up and dust rose into thick clouds.
There was no time to take cover.
Even if we had wanted to, there was no place to hide.

After one strafing run, the planes flew away and did not return.

We hurriedly pedaled our bicycles out of the town, intending to get far away from Đồng Quan to avoid danger.

Passing through the street, we saw a house still burning.
But strangely, from underground came the sound of a phonograph.
In those days phonographs were spring-wound machines using plastic records.

It turned out the shop owner had dug an air-raid shelter.
They had been listening to music when the planes arrived.
The owner carried the entire phonograph down into the shelter.
So the machine kept playing.

During the resistance against the Americans to save the South, I had many strange brushes with death.

In 1966, the armed reconnaissance unit of the Ban An ninh Khu Sài Gòn – Gia Định was stationed in a hamlet of An Tây commune in Bến Cát district of Bình Dương province.
I came there for a meeting with the unit.
Before we even began our work, enemy aircraft arrived to strafe and bomb the hamlet.

We went down into a bomb shelter dug beneath a large bamboo clump.

Suddenly a bomb exploded right above our heads.
My ears rang.
My head reeled.
Earth rained down on us.

When the planes had flown away, we climbed up to the surface.
The entire bamboo clump had vanished.
Only a dark scorched patch remained on the ground.
If that bamboo clump had not taken the blast, everyone in the shelter—including me—would have been finished.

$ * * * $

From the end of 1965, the American 25th Division “Tropic Lightning” had taken position at Đồng Dù in Củ Chi.
The American 1st Division “Big Red One” was based at Lai Khê in Bình Dương.
They had 175-millimeter long-range artillery with rocket-assisted shells.
With this kind of shell, you only heard the “departure” sound after the shell had already exploded near you.
From Lai Khê, they regularly fired 175-millimeter shells across the Sài Gòn River into the liberated areas of Củ Chi district.

At that time, every night we had to sleep inside artillery shelters.

$ * * * $

Once, during a Khu uỷ meeting, we rotated meeting locations among different offices to keep things secret and safe.
One night, the senior leaders were meeting in an underground shelter.
The lamp was carefully covered, to avoid being spotted by enemy night-time reconnaissance aircraft.

Suddenly we heard loud chatter and laughter above the roof of the meeting shelter.
We looked up to see what was happening.
It turned out the guards were playing tú-lơ-khơ and were enjoying themselves too much.
A hurricane lamp was burning brightly “so they could see the cards clearly.”

$ * * * $

Another time, the meeting was moved to the Bộ Tư lệnh Quân khu.
There they had just dug additional sleeping shelters, so the roofs were only covered with sheets of corrugated iron against the rain.
They had not yet laid beams on the roof or covered it with earth.

Anh Năm Xuân, anh Tư Trường, and I slept in the same shelter.
Our hammocks were strung along its length.

That afternoon, after dinner, I was lying in my hammock listening to the radio.
Suddenly I noticed artillery fire being walked in from afar.
I told the two comrades, “Watch out, they may be firing toward us.”

Before I could finish speaking, we heard the whistling sound—meaning the shells were close.
Still holding the radio, I jumped out of the hammock.
The three of us crawled into the side niche of the shelter just in time.

A shell exploded right on the edge of the shelter’s opening.
Earth and stones flew everywhere.
Black smoke filled the shelter.

When things were quiet, we stepped out of the niche.
Comrades from nearby shelters ran over.
They found the three of us with our faces blackened.

My hammock had been pierced from end to end by shrapnel.
My document case, which I had not managed to bring into the niche, had also taken a piece of shrapnel.
It pierced halfway into the box before it was stopped by the papers inside.
If I had not jumped out of the hammock in time, my whole body would have taken a line of shrapnel.

Afterwards, comrades sewed me a new hammock and stored the damaged one as a keepsake.
Later, the storage area was hit by a bomb and the hammock was destroyed.

$ * * * $

When we were in ấp Dược of Phú Mỹ Hưng commune, American artillery fired continuously every night from dusk until around five in the morning.
We no longer built large shelters for many people but dug individual artillery shelters instead.
Each was just long enough that at night you could place two tầm vông poles at the ends and hang a hammock for one person.
By being dispersed, if something happened, casualties would be fewer.

One night, while everyone was asleep, we heard 175-millimeter shells exploding in the area.
As for me, I clearly felt a shell explode right above my shelter’s roof.
My ears rang.
My head ached.
My hammock swung inside the earth.
But as I was still conscious, I knew I was alive.
For fear of more shells, we waited until morning to look.

Sure enough, the shelter I slept in had had a large chunk of the termite mound above it blown off by a 175-millimeter shell.
I survived thanks to that termite mound.

A termite mound is formed when termites eat underground and excrete soil mixed with their saliva, building small towers above the ground.
This soil is very hard—sometimes harder than cement—and sparks fly when you strike it with a hoe.
The ấp Dược area had many termite mounds.

The guards came up with the idea of digging artillery shelters beneath these mounds.
They only needed to dig down about a meter, and the termite mound already formed the upper half of the shelter above ground.
At night, placing two tầm vông poles across the entrance was enough to hang a hammock and make a safe sleeping shelter.
The mounds were spaced five to ten meters apart, so individual shelters were well separated.

Although the 175-millimeter shell exploded right on top of my shelter, it hit the mound and only blew off a section.
Down below, I was not hit by the blast pressure, which went upward.
I only suffered ringing ears and a spinning head from the sound.

$ * * * $

Yet this was not as strange as another time when I narrowly escaped death in Củ Chi.

Whenever I went to a cấp uỷ meeting, I always rose early to reach the meeting place on time.
Usually I left at five in the morning.
The American base at Lai Khê typically fired artillery from about eleven at night until nearly five in the morning.
After that, it seemed they woke up, washed, ate, and stopped nighttime shelling.
From five in the morning until evening, the daytime forces took over.
They sent “bà già” aircraft to patrol, and only when they spotted something unusual did they call for artillery or fighter-bombers.

That day, for reasons I still do not understand, Ba Phước—the guard—said, “Let’s eat early and leave early today.”
So we departed before five in the morning.
The two of us rode two bicycles along the red-dirt road through the rubber plantation, hoping to move quickly before enemy aircraft might patrol.

Just past Hố Bò, we heard shells exploding in the distance.
Then the explosions drew closer along the stretch of road we were on.
I told Ba Phước, “Watch out, it’s going to reach us.”

No sooner had I said that than we heard the whistling.
We jumped off our bicycles and pressed ourselves against the trunk of a rubber tree.
The bicycles kept rolling by inertia for a few meters before collapsing.

A violent explosion erupted above us.
Flames flashed.
Smoke engulfed everything.

We found ourselves still conscious.
Each of us called out to the other to see if we were hurt.
We felt our arms and legs and found them intact.
We stood up and looked around.

The trunks of the surrounding rubber trees were packed with steel darts.

It turned out that day the Americans were not using regular shells that exploded on impact.
They were using air-burst shells that detonated a few meters above the ground for greater effect.
They were also using shells that scattered thousands of steel darts upon exploding.

Fortunately, we had not been standing upright.
Had we stood, we would have been struck by the steel darts.

By lying against the trunks of the rubber trees, we were below the line where the darts embedded themselves—about thirty centimeters above the ground.

Preparing for the attack and uprising during Tết Mậu Thân 1968, the liberated communes in Củ Chi had been bulldozed flat by American troops.
We had to cross through An Tịnh (Trảng Bàng) and temporarily move to An Ninh commune (Đức Hòa), on the bank of the Sài Gòn River by provincial road 10, to continue our work.

This was a weak area.
A ngụy outpost stood right on road 10 at the turnoff into the commune.
There were no large sweeps as in Củ Chi, but small groups of ngụy soldiers could still push into the hamlets, looking for food and supplies.
The most dangerous were the Americans, who used helicopters to suddenly drop troops for searches.

We had been there only a few days when, one morning at around nine, enemy helicopters came roaring in.
In no time the hamlet was full of American soldiers.
The du kích fired a few shots to raise the alarm, then had to slip away, because they could not “take on” such forces.

The two guards and I went down into a secret shelter dug at the base of a bamboo clump.

After a while, we heard rustling above us, and through the air hole earth fell down onto our heads.
The young guards did not know English, so they paid no attention.
But I clearly heard the Americans saying to each other, “Here! Here!”
At the same time there was a sound like an iron probe poking into the earth around the bamboo clump.
Our hearts nearly stopped.

Then suddenly it all went quiet.

I whispered to the two guards that the Americans were right above us.

Our guns were loaded, and we had loosened the grenade pins.
If they found the shelter’s mouth, we would have to throw the lid open and fight our way out, then run.
We could not simply lie still and let them open the lid and take us.

But it stayed silent.

The air in the shelter grew suffocating.
I have a weak heart, so I felt it more quickly than the others.
I had to lie face down on the ground to breathe the cooler air where there was still more oxygen, yet I could hardly bear it.

We agreed that we would have to open the lid.
Better to fight and die than suffocate in the shelter.

We had just made ready when we again heard rustling above the mouth of the shelter and a voice calling, “Come up! Come up!”

Could it be someone captured by the enemy and forced to point out our shelter?

We kept silent and listened.

It was clearly anh Bảy Bình’s voice.

Again he called out:
“Anh Tư, the Americans have withdrawn.”

We pushed the lid up.
Bảy Bình stuck his head down, smiling.

The comrades pulled me up first.
When I was stretched out on the ground, I lay there gasping for some time.

Had it been only a little later, I do not know how things would have turned out.

$ * * * $
Around the third or fourth day of Tết Mậu Thân 1968, I was in Khánh Hội when we received word that the next day the enemy would sweep the neighborhoods there.

Since I had already sent giao liên ahead to scout the route, I decided to leave for Bình Thới.

From Cây Bàng ward, after we had walked a bit from the house, cô Hai Tre, our giao liên, hailed a xích lô to take the two of us to Nancy pier.
From there we took a xe lam toward Chợ Lớn.

The xe lam only ran one section before it had to stop, as we entered an area with new fighting.
We had to get off and walk.
Along the road the enemy had strung barbed wire, leaving only a narrow passage.
We saw men in dark glasses pacing about, whom we took to be secret police.
But if we had hesitated or turned back, we would have aroused suspicion.
We walked calmly through.
Only when we had gone some distance did we look for another xe lam to finish the last part of the journey.

Along the way we saw people from the workers’ quarters, clutching blankets and clothes, trudging along in groups; some had blood streaming down their faces.

Looking into the workers’ quarter, we saw American “bird-dog” helicopters pouring machine-gun fire and starting many fires.
Knowing our armed forces relied on the workers’ quarters, the Americans aimed to wipe them out.
Later they rebuilt those areas with brick houses, giving profits to contractors and making it harder for our forces to maintain bases.

When we reached Bình Thới, we went to the house of anh chị Ba Trương.

Hai Tre then went back to district 4 to bring the remaining armed security guards who were still at the pagoda back to district 6.
On the way, chú Kẹn was stopped by the police, who suspected him of being a draft dodger.
But Tám Tiếm and Út Đắng slipped through and were again hidden in Bình Thới pagoda.

A Biệt động unit was temporarily stationed in the pagoda.
When we asked, they said that that night they would go to meet cánh Hai Sang, Bí thư of Bình Tân district, and that anh Sáu Dân was said to be there.
I needed to meet anh Sáu Dân, so I arranged to go with them that evening.

Around eight at night, we joined the Biệt động unit and set off for Bình Tân.

Not far from the pagoda, we suddenly heard German shepherds barking.
I told the Biệt động commander, “Be careful, there may be American troops nearby.”

I had barely finished speaking when enemy machine-gun fire poured toward us.
Rounds striking the gravel road sparked.
We leapt down into the roadside ditch.
Bamboo thorns tore our clothes and scraped our arms and legs.

When the shooting stopped, we called to each other to move away at once.

At a stretch with houses, comrades took cover in doorways and gate recesses.
I stood behind a comrade carrying a B.40.

The commander ordered a B.40 round fired toward the enemy machine gun.
The B.40 gunner fired.
I saw a flash of flame shoot out behind the tube, dazzling my eyes.
If I had not been standing slightly off to the side, the flame would have blasted straight into my face, and I might have been badly burned or killed on the spot.

I called to everyone to move at once, before the enemy called in artillery.
We moved.
A few minutes later the enemy indeed fired artillery onto the area where we had just been hiding.

Back at the pagoda, seeing that we could not continue that night, I left Tám Tiếm and Út Đắng with the Biệt động unit and returned in the middle of the night to anh chị Ba’s house nearby.

People fleeing the fighting were sleeping in rows on the veranda and floor of the house.

I went inside and washed.
By lamplight I saw a cut on my wrist; I did not know whether it was from bamboo thorns or from hitting my hand on the gravel road.
My automatic watch had stopped.

The next morning, a column of American tanks surrounded the pagoda.

There was news that a sweep in that area was imminent.
Hai Tre and I decided to move to Bà Điểm.
On a Honda motorbike we played the part of civilians fleeing the fighting, each of us carrying a blanket.
Near Tân Sơn Nhất, traffic was jammed and we had to ride through the fields.

When we reached Bà Điểm, we went to the home of anh Năm Tấn.

We stayed there one night.
The next day we saw enemy tanks crawling through the fields.
One parked right near the house.
The family shut all the doors and told me to stay quietly inside.
American soldiers walked around the area but did not enter any house.

The day after that, seeing things quiet, I borrowed a motorbike and rode back to Củ Chi to reestablish contact with the An Ninh units in the city.

On the road, I met a convoy of American vehicles going in the same direction.

At a stretch where there were potholes full of water, I had to swerve.
An American jeep behind me overtook my bike and almost collided with it.
As it passed, a soldier raised his carbine and took aim at me.
I do not know whether he meant it as a joke or not.
I stopped the motorbike.
Only when their convoy had gone some distance did I see him lower the gun.

Much later I learned that on that same day, American tanks had surrounded Bình Thới pagoda and wiped out the entire armed unit sheltering there.
So Tám Tiếm and Út Đắng must have shared that fate.
Tám Tiếm’s wife in Hóc Môn sent word many times asking for news.
Út Đắng’s family was in An Tịnh.
He had a sweetheart named Hoa from Đức Hòa.
To this day, no one knows where they were buried.

$ * * * $
After the first phase of Tết Mậu Thân 1968, we moved to the Gò Đen area of Long An, then called Phân khu 3, along highway 4 to better direct operations in Sài Gòn.

We rotated our office location.
Sometimes we were in Phước Vân, sometimes in Long Cang or Long Định.

One day, while we were in Long Cang, the enemy launched a sweep.
Our armed forces coordinated with the du kích, both fighting the sweep and providing protection.

In that area the youth were excellent.
They refused to join the enemy army, and even those who were drafted sometimes escaped and came home.
Such were the enemy sweeps, but whenever they slipped out of the sweep’s path, the young men would find some rice wine to drink.

That day was the same.
Hearing machine-gun fire at the entrance to the hamlet, we knew the sweep troops had spotted some young men in a wine shop trying to run.

The comrades told me to go down into a secret shelter dug at the edge of a dry, raised field.
A security team took position along the bank of a nearby canal.

The sound of machine guns grew closer to where I sat.

I began to hear the crackling of burning grass around me.
Then the sound of grass burning right above the lid of my shelter.
Smoke drifted in, making it hard to breathe and stinging my eyes.

I used a dried areca spathe as a fan, waving until my arm was tired, but it did no good.
I finally thought of a way.
I urinated onto a cloth and used it to wipe my face so my eyes would sting less.
Smoke still poured in.

After a while, the sound of burning grass died down.

I guessed the enemy had passed this spot.
But strangely, the guards did not report anything.
Perhaps the enemy was still lurking nearby in ambush.

I was suffocating.
Perhaps I would have to throw open the lid and climb out.

Then I thought it through.
The grass that had burned above the lid had turned to ash.
If I opened the shelter, it would be exposed and could no longer be used, because no one could spread ash back in exactly the same way as the original layer.

As I was still hesitating, I heard noise above the lid.
Then the lid was lifted from outside.

It turned out the guards had gone to check the situation and, once they were sure the enemy had pulled out, they came to call me up.

$ * * * $
Also in Phước Vân in 1968, the family that owned the house where we stayed lived legally under the enemy administration.
Even so, they let us set up our office in their home.

Without telling the owner, the guards built a secret shelter for me right in the garden.

The shelter was made from the largest kind of earthen water jar, which local people called a “mái” water jar.
It was big enough for a person to slip into and sit cross-legged inside.

The area was low-lying.
Each day, floodwater flowed into the ditches and then receded.
To bury the “mái” in the ground, we had to fill it with water so it would sink.
If we tried to bury it empty, groundwater would push it up like a floating ball, and no human effort could keep it down.
Only when the soil around the jar had dried could we bail the water out.
Then the “mái” would stay buried in the earth.

Every morning, we had to secretly check the shelter and bail out any water that had seeped in through the air hole.
If we forgot and trouble came when the shelter was full of water, we would have to abandon it.

Sitting for long periods in such a secret shelter, you were not soaked and chilled, but your arms and legs were cramped and uncomfortable.

At that time, anh Sáu Châu was living with me.

Anh Sáu Châu was from An Nhơn in Bình Định.
He had gone North in 1955 as part of the tập kết and returned to the South before I did.
At the Ban An ninh Trung ương cục, I met him.
He was gentle in temperament and conscientious in his work.
So when I went to the Ban An ninh Khu Sài Gòn – Gia Định, I requested that he come work with me.

When he confided in me, he had a private sadness.

After the Geneva Agreement, he married and only a few days later left to tập kết.
He thought he would return in two years, but more than ten years had passed.
His home was right by Bình Định town, a weak area.
After he reached Nam bộ, he asked people to “reach out” to his family, but no one was found.
He only heard that his wife had married someone else.

At the R, he reported to the Party cell and asked permission to start a new family.
The cell did not agree.
The reason was that many comrades who had tập kết to the North had reported similar cases; after fellow villagers vouched for them and they remarried, they later received letters from their former wives in the South.
Anh Sáu Châu respected discipline and submitted to the cell’s decision.
He told me privately and swore he had no reason to lie to the organization.
I could not give a different opinion, though I trusted him and felt for his situation.

Back in Củ Chi, he sometimes helped us maintain contact with inner-city bases.
There was one woman cadre, gentle and kind, whose husband had been killed.
Anh Sáu Châu was sometimes assigned to give her political and professional training.
On one occasion, when I came to a safe house used to meet inner-city contacts, I saw the two of them talking quietly and clearly in tune with each other.
I thought that if Sáu Châu were allowed, building a family with her would make a beautiful couple.

Returning to Phước Vân.

Sáu Châu had been living with me there for several months.

Once, I had to go back to Củ Chi for a meeting with the armed reconnaissance unit.
Whenever I was in Phước Vân, if the enemy swept the area, I always used the secret shelter made from the “mái” water jar along the row of coconut trees and considered it the best place.

That time, because I was away, when the enemy swept the area, Sáu Châu used my shelter.
The sweep lasted from morning until afternoon, and then the enemy withdrew.

From inside the secret shelter, Sáu Châu opened the lid.
He had just emerged halfway, with his upper body above the ground.

Suddenly an American helicopter flew straight in from afar.
No one knows whether the pilot saw anything or not, but an air-to-surface rocket exploded and flew straight into Sáu Châu.
He was killed on the spot.

When I returned to Phước Vân, he was gone.

I grieved for him, not only because he had never found happiness in his private life.
He was also younger than I was.
How could he die before me?

More than twenty years passed.

In 1990, I finally had the chance to visit Phước Vân again.

The old lady who had housed us had died.
Her daughter, chị Hai, had also passed away.

Her grandson, who had been a child then, had built a thatched house on the family land.

He showed me the “mái” I had once used as a secret shelter.
He had dug it out of the ground and used it to collect rainwater for drinking.

My heart stirred.
Images of those earlier years came back.

Was this water jar the very shelter that Sáu Châu used on the day of the sweep, when he died at its mouth?

If I had not gone away to that meeting, would it not have been me who took the rocket instead?

Anh Sáu Châu, many times I have told myself that you died in my place that day.

$ * * * $
In 1970, when we were in Châu Thành, Bến Tre, one day the enemy swept Phước Thạnh commune.
I was in the upper hamlet, while anh Sáu Thành’s office was in the lower hamlet.
Just after midday, we heard bursts of automatic fire, followed by enemy artillery into the office area.

The guards and I went down into a shelter.
As I stepped down, I suddenly fainted and collapsed.
Fortunately the guards pulled me back up immediately.
Had I gone alone, I would have died face down in the water that nearly filled the shelter.

By late afternoon the enemy withdrew.
When I returned to the office, I learned that our unit had lost six people killed that day.
Later we heard that the sweep was based on an informer’s tip, so the enemy had hit the office exactly.
They began the sweep, then pretended to pull back to make our people relax.
Sure enough, some went home to boil water, others climbed out of their shelters for fresh air.
A flanking enemy unit moved in and shot anyone they saw.

Anh Sáu Thành was shot dead on the rim of a secret shelter.
Beside his body and a machine-gun ammunition box, papers and documents were scattered all over the ground.

We had agreed on a system.
Each person had a machine-gun ammunition box for documents.
These metal boxes had very tight rubber seals.
In a sweep, we buried the boxes in the mud and dug them up afterwards to work again.
Each of us then had only our weapon to fight with, and if we fell, the documents would not be lost.

I never understood why anh Sáu Thành carried his document box out to the secret shelter with him, so that when the enemy searched, they scattered everything.
I would not see the consequences of this until I myself was captured.

$ * * * $
In any case, all of the above were brushes with death at the hands of a distant enemy.

After 23 December 1970, I was unlucky enough to be captured.
This time it was no longer a matter of facing the enemy from afar.

It was a direct confrontation.
They used many methods to try to force from me the bases and secrets that I knew.
From March to November 1971, I endured long periods of torture.

At the end of November 1971, they suddenly stopped torturing me.

Then came the 1973 Paris Agreement.
But the enemy still refused to return me to our side.

On 30 April 1975, when our troops attacked Sài Gòn, a bộ đội unit freed me from the prison at 3 Bạch Đằng run by the Trung ương Tình báo of the ngụy regime.

After my release, I learned of two matters related to my life and death during my imprisonment.

First, in late 1971, our side released an American non-commissioned officer and entrusted him with a letter from the Mặt trận Dân tộc giải phóng miền Nam Việt Nam, signed by anh Trần Bạch Đằng, proposing to the Americans an exchange of myself for an American officer.
That was why the ngụy intelligence service had to stop torturing me from that time on.
Throughout the period from late 1971 until just before 30 April 1975, I could not understand this strange change.

Second, after 30 April 1975, ngụy intelligence personnel sent to reeducation reported that on 26 April 1975, before fleeing Sài Gòn, the American CIA, through Nguyễn Khắc Bình—Đặc ủy trưởng Tình báo trung ương and concurrently Tổng Giám đốc Cảnh sát of the ngụy regime—had ordered them to kill me “quietly.”
But seeing that our troops were already at the gates of Sài Gòn, the lower-level staff did not dare carry out the order, fearing heavier guilt before the Cách mạng.
Frank Snepp, on the other hand, wrote in his memoir published in 1977 that the CIA planned to put me on a helicopter and throw me into the East Sea.
As for me, I clearly remember that at dinner on 26 April 1975, the pickled gourd soup had a strange taste, so I did not eat it and poured it all away.
Whatever the real events, the outcome was that I survived.

In short, the enemy did not succeed in killing me, either physically or mentally.

A cheerful friend once remarked, “You were born in the year of the Tiger.
Heaven’s lightning could not kill you.
How could the enemy ever kill you?”
