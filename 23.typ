= 23. Around the book Bất Khuất
(Recorded from the account of anh Nguyễn Đức Thuận)

1 — Early in 1964, I went to the South to take part directly in the resistance against the Americans.
I will not recount here my journey to reach the base of the Trung ương Cục miền Nam (R), then located in the Dương Minh Châu war zone of Tây Ninh.
I only record here the story of meeting anh Nguyễn Đức Thuận in mid–1964 at the Office of the Trung ương Cục miền Nam, just before he returned to the North.

2 — That day, several of us from Ban An ninh Trung ương Cục had gone to work with the Thường vụ Trung ương Cục.
After dinner, we rested for the evening, to continue work the next day.

Guests stayed in a hut with a thatched roof and no walls.
(If rain blew in, sheets of nylon would be hung as walls; otherwise, it was left open.)
Each person had his own hammock to rest and sleep in.
There was a table made from a plank resting on four wooden stakes, and two planks on either side serving as benches.

As we were drinking tea, a few comrades from other huts came to sit and talk.
Among them, with comrades I already knew, was a slightly short man with bright eyes.
Anh Sáu Hoàng, Deputy Chief of Ban An ninh Trung ương Cục — one of the cadres who had stayed in the South after the Genève Agreements and who had arrived at the Trung ương Cục with me — asked if I recognized him.
I hesitated; I could not quite recall where or when I had met him.
Anh Sáu Hoàng introduced everyone to each other.
Only then did I realize that the man who seemed familiar was anh Nguyễn Đức Thuận, newly released from prison after the coup that overthrew Ngô Đình Diệm on 1 November 1963.

I suddenly remembered: in 1948, in the North, when I was at the Liên tỉnh ủy Lưỡng Hà (Hà Nội – Hà Đông) under anh Lê Quang Đạo.
That summer, the enemy had staged a parachute drop into Vân Đình town — based on intelligence they had gathered suggesting they intended to capture our delegation from the South traveling to the North.
On the day of the drop, I happened to be working in Thanh Oai district, so after the enemy withdrew, I returned to the Liên tỉnh ủy Office (then located in a village below Vân Đình) to see whether anything had happened.
There I met several comrades from the Nam Bộ delegation to the North.
Among them was đồng chí Nguyễn Đức Thuận, Deputy Secretary of the Xứ ủy.
He was a Northerner but had been imprisoned on Côn Đảo.
After the August Revolution of 1945, he was released and joined the resistance in Nam Bộ.
I remembered his face, his smile, and his straightforward manner of speaking, even though it was our first meeting.

Before arriving at the Trung ương Cục Office that day in 1964, I had not known that anh Thuận had stayed in the South after the Genève Agreements and had been arrested by the Ngô family’s secret police.
So we gathered around and asked him to tell us the story of his imprisonment, and of the comrades imprisoned with him.
We listened late into the night, questioning him whenever something was unclear; and he answered immediately.

3 — I remember clearly the stories he told.

Among them was this: when the enemy used high-powered lamps to shine directly into his eyes during interrogation, whenever the commander walked away, the guard would turn off the light.
(It was unclear whether the guard sympathized with the revolutionaries or simply felt human pity.)

I also remember how he deliberately trained himself to answer every question with only the word “Không.”
So whether he was conscious, or delirious under torture, he would say only that word and not accidentally reveal anything.

I could see that anh Thuận told us his story with complete honesty — surely the same as what he had reported to the Organization, as required of anyone captured by the enemy and later returned.

4 — Later, I heard the following matters, which I now record here.

After our troops freed me from the Mỹ–ngụy 3 Bạch Đằng prison at noon on 30 April 1975, my health was weak, so in August 1975 I was sent for treatment in the German Democratic Republic with a delegation of Southern cadres.
There I heard that the book Bất Khuất had been published.
Some Germans, analyzing it scientifically, said that the book did not seem accurate.
Their reasoning was that physiologically, a person cannot endure continuous exposure to high-powered lights for the many days described in the book.

When I returned home at the end of 1975, I found and read Bất Khuất.
What I read matched what I had heard in Germany.

At that time, anh Thuận’s house was right next to mine (on Hàng Bông Nhuộm).
Since we had known each other in the South, I once went to ask him why the book contained such descriptions.
He said that he had only recounted the truth, and had not written it himself.
But the writer had omitted the detail about the guard turning off the lamp when the commander walked away.
He had known nothing about the publication.

I went to ask my uncle — đồng chí Lê Văn Lương — about this.
He told me that Bất Khuất had been published during wartime; perhaps people feared revealing secrets (such as endangering the guard who had turned off the light), and so they removed that part of anh Thuận’s account.

Thus, in my view: anh Thuận was completely truthful.
But the publishers had unintentionally created a misunderstanding that anh Thuận exaggerated to glorify himself — something contrary to fact, and contrary to science.

5 — I feel the need to record all this.
Because now anh Thuận, and my uncle Lê Văn Lương, have both passed away.
Anyone who ever heard anh Thuận tell his story during the anti-American years in the South has a responsibility of conscience to make the truth clear, so that people understand the real anh Thuận.
