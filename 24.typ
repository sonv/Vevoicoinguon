= 24. Tết ceasefire during the American war

From the time the United States was still waging the “special war” (Saigon troops with American advisers), the Mặt trận Dân tộc Giải phóng miền Nam Việt Nam had unilaterally declared ceasefires during Christmas and Tết Nguyên đán.
This put the opponent on the defensive, forcing them to issue similar announcements to answer public opinion.

During these times, anyone standing along the footpaths leading into the liberated zone of Củ Chi could fully grasp the meaning of this custom, and how deeply it had taken root in people’s hearts.

On the first buses and xe lam heading toward Củ Chi, the seats were filled, and people spilled out onto the roads leading that way.
Turning off the paved road, long lines of people followed the forest paths winding through the rubber plantations, toward communes like Nhuận Đức, An Nhơn, Trung Lập, and others.
Their hands were full of gifts.
Talking, chatting, laughing.
Everyone eager to walk faster, to reach the meeting spot, to see loved ones again.
Here and there, reunions happened along the paths.
Faces lit up with indescribable joy.
Some hurried to the homes of families they had known before; some chose a clear patch of ground in the rubber forest to sit and talk with their relatives.
As noon approached, the crowds grew even larger.

From inside the base area, not only cadres and fighters of T4, but even some cadres from R used the ceasefire to request permission to return to T4 to meet their families.

It was a bustling atmosphere that lasted through the day and night.

At certain points, the Uỷ ban Mặt trận Dân tộc Giải phóng T4 organized exhibitions of books and newspapers; or displayed paintings and photographs portraying the struggle of the Quân Giải phóng; or scenes of daily life in the liberated zones.

Elsewhere, there were meetings between Mặt trận cadres and people coming from enemy-controlled areas.
There were discussions about the Mặt trận’s platform, and answers to questions about its policies.

At night, there were film screenings by Điện ảnh Giải phóng, or performances of revolutionary opera and music.

Those coming from the enemy’s side who stayed to watch the performances would leave their bicycles or motorbikes in a field.
There were no tickets.
After the show, they returned to the field, and each person took their own bicycle or motorbike.
Nothing went missing.
People from the enemy-controlled areas were astonished at the “self-disciplined” order of the liberated zones.

Couples — lovers or husbands and wives — could borrow houses from acquaintances as places to talk privately.

Among the visitors from enemy-controlled areas were many Saigon soldiers.
Most had been conscripted, and felt no hostility toward “our side.”
In fact, these were also convenient moments for binh vận cadres to meet their contacts.

But few knew that during such times, some had to hurry about heavy tasks.
These were the giao liên specialists operating inside enemy zones; and those providing logistics for the armed units inside the city.
Because the ceasefire created a relaxed atmosphere and lighter enemy patrols, they made full use of the opportunity to transport bulky newspapers, and even guns, ammunition, and explosives into the city.

In mid–1965, the first American combat units were deployed to South Việt Nam, turning the U.S. invasion into a “limited war.”

After the American sweeps in Central Việt Nam in early 1966, the two U.S. divisions — the “Big Red One” and the “Tropic Lightning” — together with several independent brigades, launched their first major sweep into Củ Chi.
Củ Chi guerrillas killed many American troops.
By practical action, the guerrillas of Củ Chi helped affirm the conclusion that guerrilla forces could indeed inflict painful blows on American troops.

In this first test of fire, the tunnel system showed its effectiveness.
American soldiers, trained in regular, conventional tactics, advanced in formation.
When one was shot at a guerrilla position, they would radio for helicopters to evacuate the wounded, then call for artillery barrages, then reform themselves in perfect column formation and continue advancing.
The guerrilla position would snipe again.
And the entire “by-the-book” pattern of American troop movement repeated.
A guerrilla fired a single shot “through the apples,” wounding several Americans at once.
In that spot alone, nearly ten were killed or wounded.

There was an unforgettable comic episode.
A young nurse was captured by American soldiers.
Knowing that guerrillas were hiding underground, they forced her to crawl into the tunnel to call on them to surrender.
She descended into the tunnel.
The Americans waited above.
The result was like the story of the monkey guarding the bamboo tube.

After that major sweep came Tết Nguyên đán — and another ceasefire.

During the sweeps aimed at forcing all villagers from the liberated communes of Củ Chi into strategic hamlets — carried out directly by American troops — our people resolutely resisted and clung to their land, refusing to leave their hamlets.
They said their buffalo and cattle could not be moved.
The Americans brought flat-bottom boats and pushed their livestock aboard.

Our comrades observing the situation saw enemy helicopters lifting a large artillery piece.
Certain that there would be less bombardment that night, they were surprised when shells still fell.
Later they learned:
A farmer had insisted he could not leave because he had an ox-cart, long and cumbersome, with big wheels.
The Americans called a helicopter to lift the ox-cart away.
From a distance, the large round wheels looked like those of an artillery gun, so the guerrillas mistook it for artillery being moved.

At that time, when American troops camped overnight in Củ Chi, they were sometimes hit by our mortar fire.
The next morning, guerrillas from nearby hamlets would come to search for weapons and equipment.
They found bayonets, canned meat, canned milk, and even dried egg yolk.
Most surprising was the discovery that ordinary soldiers had only sandbags for protection, while officers each had a personal “steel coffin” to sleep in, to avoid casualties during shelling.

When the U.S. Army bulldozed and leveled all vegetation in the ten liberated communes of Củ Chi for three straight months, every afternoon at the same hour their units would regroup.
Then a heavy-lift helicopter (with two rotors) would descend, lowering a large tank with tall legs, filled with water brought from Clark Base in the Philippines.
It was water for the soldiers who had been on the sweep that day to bathe.
A bag of clean clothes was also lowered; and the next morning, another helicopter arrived to take the soiled clothes for laundering.
Stranger still, after bathing, another heavy-lift helicopter would come.
Through binoculars one could see flashes of colorful dresses.
They later learned that prostitutes were flown in for the Americans’ nightly entertainment.

They were indeed “princely soldiers” unlike any others in the world.

Typically, after a sweep, if a ceasefire occurred soon after, our comrades would use those days to repair and strengthen bunkers and sleeping shelters that had been damaged by the enemy.

Once, after a sweep, with many days still to go before Tết, our unit had to dig a new sleeping bunker.
That night, the roof frame was still unfinished, but comrades decided to sleep inside anyway — safer than sleeping on the ground.
Unexpectedly, enemy planes dropped “tactical bombs” in the night (in the North they were called “coordinate bombs”).
One bomb struck directly on the still-unfinished bunker.

No one could have imagined it: the bomb hit exactly at the foot of one comrade, severing his foot cleanly.
He survived.
The bomb did not explode; it burrowed into the ground.
Later, guerrillas dug it up to use the explosives for making anti-tank mines; it was a bomb weighing several hundred kilos.
Had it exploded, all six people sleeping in the bunker that night would have been killed.

The comrade who lost his foot was anh Hà Minh Trí.
He was the one who had once been sentenced to death by the enemy for attempting to assassinate Ngô Đình Diệm in Buôn Ma Thuột.
Today, Hà Minh Trí still works in Tây Ninh, walking with an artificial leg.

To be careless during the Tết ceasefire — celebrating with bright lights — was dangerous, because once the ceasefire ended, the enemy would have precise targets to strike.
In Châu Thành, Bến Tre, after Tết, the Trinh sát vũ trang unit of An ninh T4 was hit by a surprise bombing.
Anh Ba Hiệp, the unit chief, was killed.
Chị Ba, carrying an unborn child, also died in the same bombing.

At Tết Nguyên đán of early 1966, after the major American sweep into Củ Chi, during the ceasefire, anh Thép Mới returned from R to Củ Chi to visit me.
After we talked for a while, he said:
“I didn’t get to join you in fighting the sweep.
But at least let me go down into the tunnels to see what they’re really like.”

Nothing was easier than accommodating a guest.

We climbed down into the earth.
Thép Mới sat with his back against the tunnel wall, eyes half closed.
No one knew what he was thinking.
Only after half an hour did he return to the surface.
His face was bright with excitement.

Now Thép Mới rests forever in the Motherland’s soil.
