= 18. Cipher Service in the Struggle Against Special Forces Infiltration

The years around 1960 were the time when Mỹ–Diệm in the South shouted slogans about “marching North” and “filling the Bến Hải River.”
At the same time, they began sending groups of commando–spies into the North.
According to the analysis and directives of the Secretariat of the Central Committee at that time, these commando units were not only meant for reconnaissance or material sabotage.
They were also intended to provoke reactionary elements inside the North, preparing for a real invasion of our territory.
Therefore, a wide mass–movement had to be launched to raise vigilance and mobilize the population against commando infiltration throughout the North.

I will not recount here the vast public movement for vigilance against commandos.
I will focus only on the professional struggle of our Công an—an essential component of the overall movement—during those years.

Capturing commando agents and bringing them to public trial—to alert the masses and expose the enemy—was painstaking but not difficult.
The real problem was: how could we continue uncovering their plans, intentions, and methods?
That responsibility belonged to Công an.
When we had not yet obtained information from other sources, counterintelligence had to attempt what it could.
Through various investigation files, we had already deepened our understanding of the enemy.

Based on general counterintelligence experience and earlier investigation cases, the Ministry’s leadership directed us to open special long–term operations against commando groups.
These operations differed from ordinary cases.

Each captured agent had to be fully interrogated on missions, areas of operation, radio procedures, intelligence methods, sabotage skills, recruitment, and organizational structure.
Most importantly, we had to extract precise information on safety codes, alarm signals, and emergency protocols assigned to each group—so that if their commanders suspected anything, we could detect it.

We would then use the enemy’s own radios—those issued to the commando teams—to communicate with their headquarters.
We would feed them fabricated reports consistent with the missions originally assigned.
Through this, we would continue to uncover the enemy’s intentions.

To do so, at minimum we had to persuade or control the group’s radio operator, using him as the one to tap out the transmissions.
We could not substitute him with our own operators.
The enemy had recorded onto tape the rhythm and “handwriting” of each radio operator—much like each person’s unique handwriting.

If other members of the captured group were willing to surrender and “atone by merit,” that was even better.
They could help draft the reports using their own writing style and level of literacy—far more convincing than if we wrote them ourselves.
(Later our comrades became so familiar with their style that we could imitate it when necessary.)

However, encoding each outgoing telegram had to be monitored closely.
If we let the commando group encode it themselves, they could write one thing for us to see but encode something different, or embed alarm signals.
Similarly, during radio sessions, if we were careless, the operator might slip in secret codes.

Therefore, each special–case task unit of the Cục Bảo vệ Chính trị had to include radio operators, cipher specialists, and security personnel.

At the same time, the Party’s Ban Nghiên cứu Chính trị và Xã hội—under Trần Quốc Hoàn—supervised radio sessions.
They monitored incoming and outgoing messages to detect inconsistencies.

The Ministry had only a small radio division and a separate cipher office at the time.
Because I was both a member of the Party Committee of the Ministry and Director of the Cục Bảo vệ Chính trị, coordination with these units was smooth.

Cipher officers in these operations decoded every message alongside the commando operator to verify accuracy or detect anomalies.
Meanwhile in Hà Nội, the supervisory unit decoded every intercepted message independently and sent their results to us.

Before any radio session between a captured group and enemy headquarters, the task unit had to report via our own secure channels to request authorization.
Cipher officers therefore also handled encoding and decoding these internal communications.

Our commando teams used American radios with long–range shortwave.
Our own operators, however, were forbidden to transmit on those same devices.
They used different sets, on long–wave frequencies, so that even if the enemy detected activity, they could not determine that two sets were operating from the same coordinates.

At first there was only one such operation.
Then more appeared, in multiple provinces.
Thus, many task units had to be formed, and more radio and cipher personnel mobilized.

All these units operated deep in the forest—rain or cold—bringing their own food, far from families.
Life was extremely harsh.
Yet every comrade willingly endured hardship because they knew the stakes were high.

We had to be in the forest because the enemy had dropped their commando teams precisely into rugged highland areas.
If we transmitted from Hà Nội, it would be discovered eventually.
Failure would not only ruin a single operation, but jeopardize a major strategic plan of the Ministry and affect national security.

Looking back, I still feel deep admiration for the comrades who served in these units.
Their contributions deserve full recognition.

Since this chapter focuses on cipher work, I will not recount other lessons.
I will, however, list several cipher comrades who served in commando–counterintelligence operations from about 1960 to early 1964, when I was still in the North:
Phan Bạch Liên.
Trần Quang Hơn.
Trần Quang Giai.
Đặng Văn Long.
Nguyễn Quang Phiệt.
Nguyễn Văn Một.
Vũ Trọng Nội.

After 1964, many more participated, but I was already in the South and cannot record their names here.

One amusing story should be added.

Through our controlled operation, the enemy believed completely in “their” commando team under our control.
They promised to air–drop supplies on moonlit nights.
But one night they failed to drop supplies and instead dropped an entirely new commando team elsewhere.

This taught us an important lesson.
So on another bright moonlit night, when they promised supplies again, I suspected they might instead drop a team in the central region—on the way North or on the way back—or skip the supply drop in favor of a new insertion.

At the appointed time, I ordered an urgent cipher message to all provinces of the former Khu 4.
I told them to watch closely for enemy aircraft dropping commandos.
The cipher office prepared and dispatched the message immediately.

That night, Công an Quảng Bình captured an enemy commando team exactly because of that timely telegram.
The local unit was convinced the Ministry possessed extremely advanced detection equipment.
I let them believe it.
Such a misunderstanding was only beneficial.
Now, after decades have passed, the secret can be spoken:
The most sophisticated machine was the human brain.
The cipher unit that night worked with remarkable speed and accuracy.

Looking back more than thirty years later, I believe all those cipher comrades fulfilled their missions honorably.
And they can rightly take pride in having lived through a time worth remembering.
