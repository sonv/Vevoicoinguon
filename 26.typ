= 26. Remembering that spring

In those days, the base of the Khu ủy Sài Gòn – Gia Định as well as Ban An ninh T4 was located in the ten liberated communes north of Củ Chi district (in today’s Hồ Chí Minh City).

After our victory at Bình Giã, the Mỹ–ngụy “special war” was in reality bankrupt, forcing the United States to deploy American troops directly and wage a full-scale ground war in the South.

From 1965 onward, after American troops entered the southern battlefield, they considered the areas of Bến Cát and Củ Chi on both sides of the Sài Gòn River to be the “Iron Triangle.”
Thus, they stationed Division 1, nicknamed the “Big Red One,” in Bến Cát – Bình Dương; and Division 25 (“Tropic Lightning”) in Củ Chi, to protect Sài Gòn and destroy our liberated zones in that region.

They launched dozens of sweeps — some at division scale — and every month at least one brigade-level sweep, with aircraft, artillery, and tanks, hoping to wipe out the Củ Chi base.
The base was repeatedly bombed by B-52s, and subjected to nightly artillery fire; during the day, aircraft bombed continuously.

In the autumn of 1967, the Khu ủy Sài Gòn – Gia Định convened a meeting.
For safety, following the suggestion of the Trung ương Cục, the meeting had to be moved to their base in the South.
Unexpectedly, anh Nguyễn Văn Vịnh, envoy of the Bộ Chính trị, arrived and conveyed the Party’s assessment:

If in the coming dry season the enemy was no longer capable of launching a strategic counteroffensive, then we would seize the initiative and strike directly at the urban centers, with Sài Gòn as the focal point — possibly at the beginning of 1968.

Hearing anh Vịnh relay the Politburo’s decision, all comrades in the Khu ủy were excited; each had long wished for that day.

After the meeting, I returned to Củ Chi to organize the security-related work assigned to our sector.
At the same time, American forces conducted sweeps and bulldozed all houses and trees in the ten liberated communes north of Củ Chi.
They did this relentlessly for months, leaving behind only a flat plain.

According to the Khu ủy’s direction, the mission of An ninh T4 during the Tổng tấn công and uprising in early spring 1968 was to eliminate the cruel and bloodstained agents, especially the ringleaders, to support the masses in rising up.

Because the Củ Chi base was no longer safe, we temporarily moved to several communes along the Vàm Cỏ Đông River in Đức Hòa district, Long An Province, to prepare our work.

A few days before Tết, I received the superior’s order with the specific date and hour of the Tổng tấn công and uprising in Sài Gòn: the night of the first day of Tết.

I summoned the key cadres of the An ninh units from inner Sài Gòn to An Ninh Commune (on the Vàm Cỏ Đông riverbank) to convey the order.

On the evening of the 29th of Tết, comrades gathered in a thatched house, under the flag of the Mặt trận Dân tộc Giải phóng miền Nam Việt Nam and the light of an oil lamp.

We held a ceremony to read the proclamation of the Uỷ ban Trung ương Mặt trận Dân tộc Giải phóng miền Nam Việt Nam on the Tổng tấn công and uprising.
Almost everyone present was moved to tears upon hearing the proclamation.
On behalf of the leadership of Ban An ninh T4, I gave Tết greetings to the comrades and the units.
We passed around a bottle, each taking a small sip of liquor, exchanging New Year’s wishes and pledging to fulfill our assigned tasks.

That entire night, no one could sleep; everyone only wished for dawn so they could return to their units in the inner city in time.

At noon on the 30th of Tết, using false papers, an inner-city contact escorted me by motorbike into Sài Gòn.
I stayed first at a location in Bình Thới.
The family had prepared a Tết meal for me, but none of us had the appetite to think about eating.

I spent the time meeting the key cadres of the An ninh T4 units to check their preparations.
Some units had received their full complement of weapons; others had run into problems in transport and had not received full supplies.

Seeing some comrades anxious, I told them:
“Use whatever weapons you have, whatever kind you have, to carry out your mission.”

The night of the 30th of Tết was filled with the atmosphere of the holiday ceasefire, so the soldiers and police of the Sài Gòn regime were noticeably relaxed.

But on the morning of the first day of Tết, foreign radio broadcasts reported that our forces had attacked Huế.
By that evening, when I went out to assess the situation again, I saw that the enemy had deployed troops in segments across the streets; soldiers clustered with their rifles along the sidewalks; and at important locations, they had strengthened defenses.

To facilitate command, comrades brought me to another safe house in Khánh Hội ward.

Near midnight on the first day of Tết, I turned on the radio to monitor events.
Because Đài phát thanh Sài Gòn broadcast 24 hours a day, at the start of each hour, after announcing the time, they usually aired a few news items followed by music.
When the moment to attack arrived, I heard only static after the time announcement, with no news broadcast.
Knowing the plan ahead of time, I judged that the biệt động assigned to seize the radio station had succeeded.

But after waiting several minutes and hearing no broadcast of the proclamation of the Uỷ ban Trung ương Mặt trận Dân tộc Giải phóng miền Nam Việt Nam, I thought something must have gone wrong there.

From Khánh Hội, I also heard small-arms fire from the direction of Dinh Độc Lập, but could not determine what had happened.

Not until the morning of the second day of Tết, through foreign radio, did I learn that our biệt động had attacked the U.S. Embassy in Sài Gòn, fought heroically, and had reached the Sài Gòn radio station, but could not complete the planned broadcast.

Through giao liên, I received reports from An ninh T4 units.
The private residence of U.S. Ambassador Bunker was so heavily defended that our fighters could not break in.
Nguyễn Văn Thiệu had gone to Mỹ Tho for Tết and was not in Sài Gòn.

In addition to eliminating enemy agents in various parts of the city and warning collaborators without blood debts, an armed squad of An ninh T4 was assigned to guide a main-force battalion attacking the Tổng Nha Cảnh sát from the south of Sài Gòn.
They encountered fierce resistance.
Later I learned that nearly the entire squad had died heroically in that battle; some severely wounded comrades had been captured and imprisoned.

Another armed security unit protecting Tiền phương 2 south of Sài Gòn fought bravely to keep the command safe.
One inner-city security unit attacked the Embassy of the Philippines, which at that time had sent troops to fight alongside the Mỹ–ngụy forces.

After the first phase of the Tổng tấn công và nổi dậy, higher command ordered further attacks on the urban areas.
The An ninh T4 fighters both overcame the enemy’s intense surveillance to hold their positions and build additional bases, and continued transporting weapons into hiding places.

Brave and resourceful, the An ninh T4 fighters achieved many operations that resounded across the city.
Among them were the grenade attacks (explosive and incendiary) on Thiếu tướng Kiểm, Chief of Staff of the Special Bureau of the ngụy Presidency; the attack on the motorcade of Prime Minister Trần Văn Hương in one of the areas considered safest by the enemy; the bombing of the parking lot at the entrance of the Tổng Nha Cảnh sát at rush hour; the bombing at the Quốc Thanh Theater, where ngụy police and secret agents gathered to entertain themselves; and twice managing to slip a vehicle carrying H.12 rockets through layers of enemy checkpoints to the gate of the Tổng Nha Cảnh sát — only to have a faulty fuse scatter the rockets, killing the operator.

Not to mention the intelligence work, which gathered vital information and established certain assets that remained useful until 30 April 1975.

In both the dramatic and the silent achievements, we must not forget the contributions of the female giao liên — from the older women, the sisters, to the teenage girls of fifteen or sixteen.
Many were captured and brutally tortured, yet never broke, keeping their secrets and revolutionary integrity.
Some were killed; others, released from prison, still bear permanent injuries from the torture.

Twenty-six years have passed.
Those An ninh T4 fighters who took part in the Tổng tấn công và nổi dậy — many now rest forever beneath the earth, such as anh Năm Tấn (Deputy Chief of An ninh T4), Năm Phụng, Năm Mai, Tám Phong (members of the leadership), and many others whose names cannot all be listed at once.
Some comrades remain alive and active — Năm Thu, Ba Đạo, Hai Cầu, Út Cạn, and others.
Some endured long imprisonment — Hai Minh, Tư Phong.
Some are now retired — Ba Dũng, Tư Hổ, Ba Mẫu, Sáu Sinh, Chín Hà.

Each lives in a different place, but whenever we meet again, we always recall the memories of that spring — the spring of attack and uprising — and never forget the dear comrades who did not live to see our nation’s final victory.

Spring of Ất Hợi — 1995
