= Preface
For a long time now, my friends have told me that I should record the stories of my life. 
I often replied that there was nothing out of ordinary.
As for police matters, there are specialized agencies in charge of that.
As for other matters worth mentioning, it wasn’t yet the time to bring many of them up.

Yet, they kept urging me to write:
even without any plan to publish,
it could at least be for my family and loved ones.

On December 11, 1996, I had just crossed the "cổ lai hy" milestone--seventy years of age. 
So, at the start of 1997, I decided to compile this volume, _Back to the Roots_.


_Back to the Roots_ is a collection of thirty short memoirs, arranged chronologically. 
They tell of my beloved family, the leaders who nurtured my growth, the friends 
who shared hardships with me, and the people across Vietnam who sheltered and helped me through the wars. 
Many have since passed on; to them I offer my deepest, most affectionate respect.
