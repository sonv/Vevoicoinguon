= 27. A “double” victory

After I was captured on the Cửu Long River at the end of December 1970, they took me from the interrogation office of the Cảnh sát in Bến Tre, to the interrogation office of the Cảnh sát and Quân báo of Tactical Region IV in Cần Thơ, then to the intelligence office of Sư đoàn 7 ngụy in Bình Đức, Mỹ Tho.
Finally, from early 1971, they transferred me to Sài Gòn and locked me up at 3 Bạch Đằng, the headquarters of the Central Intelligence of the ngụy regime.

At that time, my real identity had not been exposed, and none of the traitors had yet come to point me out.
I still maintained the false identity of Captain Nguyễn Văn Hợp, an intelligence officer who had just gone South on a weapons ship into Vàm Mang Cung in Bến Tre, which Sài Gòn newspapers had reported captured in November 1970, while those on board had supposedly escaped earlier.

American and Vietnamese interrogators were questioning me.

Besides the two American interrogators who alternated to cross-check, they also used technical devices and various “tradecraft games” to evaluate my statements.

One day, the younger American who usually questioned me stepped out for a while.
When he returned, an older American came with him, carrying a wooden box.
The two of them spoke privately in English.
When they finished, the younger one said through the interpreter: “I have to go, this man will continue with you.”

The older American opened the box.
Through the interpreter, he explained what I was to do and requested that I answer his questions.
He opened some books.
They were all pictures.
One section was just different eyes; another, various noses, mouths, eyebrows, and so on.
Then ears, hair, and whole faces.

He placed a board about the size of a notebook on the table, with two small metal pegs fixed onto a little rectangular piece.
He brought out several boxes full of transparent mica sheets.
On each sheet, printed in black, there was either a nose, or a mouth, or an ear.

He explained: among the four people who supposedly traveled with me on the ship and left Bến Tre before I did, I was to recall each face.
Looking at the books, whenever I saw eyes, a chin, or ears that resembled that person, I was to note the reference number and pick out the mica sheet with the same number.
Each sheet had two holes punched in it so it could fit onto the two metal pegs on the board.
Once one piece was fixed, I was to select another and place it on top.
When I finished one face, I would do the same for the next.

Because those “four people” were completely fictional, invented by me, I now had to keep thinking, imagining and fabricating four faces.
I pretended to search among the mica sheets.
From morning until late afternoon, I finally assembled four faces.

It was clear that with such a method, they could instantly see a composite face, photograph it, and use it for immediate search.
I realized at once that the Americans suspected those four “companions” of being intelligence officers as well, or at least considered them worth tracking, so they used this method of facial reconstruction.

As I assembled, the older American wrote down the code of each mica sheet.
I, for my part, had to memorize them as well, in case they forced me to do the process again later.

One morning, I was not called for interrogation at all.
I assumed there would be no session that day, as it was nearly time for the prison rations.
Unexpectedly, right then they summoned me.
The new interrogation room was not far from the previous one.

When I entered, the younger American interrogator was sitting in a corner, and another American sat in front of a set of machines.
I guessed he intended to use a polygraph test (measuring heart rate during questioning).
But compared with what I had heard about such instruments, this one was compact, about the size of a doctor’s briefcase.

They said: “Today we want to check whether you are telling the truth or lying.
We have prepared questions in English with Vietnamese translations.
You may read them first; if any question is unclear, you may request a correction.
After that, you may answer only ‘yes’ or ‘no’, nothing more.”

The questions were based on my previous statements and were not difficult.
Only one question posed a problem: “Are you an intelligence officer of the Bắc Việt Công an?”
I objected: in my country, those are two separate agencies.
If they asked like that and I answered “yes,” it would not be accurate; if I said “no,” it would also be inaccurate.
I demanded they split it into two questions, so that if they asked about intelligence, I could say “yes,” and if they asked about Công an, I could say “no,” and it would be correct, lest they later accuse me of lying.
We argued a long time, and finally they agreed.

Then the test began.
They wrapped a belt around my chest, attached wires to my ears and fingertips.
They blindfolded me and made me sit straight.
The interpreter stood behind me, reading each question slowly.
After each question, I said either “yes” or “no.”
We went on until after noon.

The next morning, right before lunch, they called me again.
I myself had not expected a second round of testing.
When I arrived, the American said: “You probably thought we were finished, didn’t you?”
Then the test continued with a new set of questions, using the same method as the day before.

At the end, the polygraph specialist said: “Now choose a number between 0 and 9.
This time, when I ask, you are allowed to lie.
I will show you how effective the machine is.”

By then I understood the principle of the test.
So when he came to the number I had chosen and I answered “no,” I simultaneously took a deep, nervous breath on purpose.
My aim was to let the machine record a strong reaction when I lied, so that, based on this, he would later review the tapes secretly recorded during my previous interrogations, compare them with the polygraph readings, and conclude that my earlier answers had all been truthful.

After the test, he examined the recordings for a moment, then correctly stated the number I had chosen.
I knew then that he had been deceived, but I pretended to be impressed by the machine.
They sent me back to my cell.

Several years later, when my identity had been exposed and the enemy refused to exchange me under the Paris Agreement of 1973 — though they no longer interrogated me — one day a guard told me: in early 1971, after the polygraph tests, the Americans had accepted my false identity.
If no one outside had inadvertently revealed who I was, they would never have found out.
And in any case, if they had already known my real identity then, they would not have bothered with those tests.

After the polygraph sessions, Sunday came and they rested.
On normal days, I would review my statements to prepare for questioning; on Sundays, when the enemy rested, I would analyze more deeply to anticipate their next moves.

But that Sunday night, they suddenly called me in for questioning.
It was a psychological ploy, the reverse of what one would expect.

This time it was another American with the same interpreter.
He introduced himself as a psychology specialist.
He said: “There will be no conclusions about truth or lies here, so you need not be afraid.”
He boasted of having worked in psychology for twenty years and having been in Việt Nam for three or four years.

He read questions through the interpreter and asked me to answer.
For example: “In what year did the Lady Trưng rise up?”
“Who wrote the Gia huấn ca?”

Then he read strings of numbers, starting with two digits, gradually increasing to more.
After hearing the series once, I had to repeat it immediately.
If I made a mistake or forgot, he simply noted it.

He brought out drawings and asked me to explain their meaning.
He produced wordless picture sequences, jumbled, and asked me to arrange them in meaningful order.
He showed a drawing of a hand, then gave me cut-out pieces from that drawing and asked me to reassemble them into the complete hand.

For each task, he timed me with a stopwatch and scored me for correctness.

Among the questions, one was: “Why is land in the city more expensive than land in the countryside?”
I answered that I did not know, but I found it strange that “dead land” could be more expensive.
He pressed me for further explanation and wrote detailed notes on a separate sheet.
Perhaps something had caught his attention.
I then explained that rural land produces food, while in the city once a building is erected the land’s productive use is gone.

He asked another question: “If someone told you that you would die in six months, what would you do in those six months, assuming you had every means available?”
I replied that, if that were my fate, I would spend that time working for my Tổ quốc with all my strength.

He asked about my family situation.
I said I felt at ease, because my family was being looked after.

At the end of the session, he asked if I had anything to say.
I replied: “Americans do not understand the psychology of Asians, nor of the Vietnamese.”

I was kept in solitary cell No. 3, at the end of the row.
Around mid–February 1971, one afternoon after interrogation, as I passed solitary cell No. 5, I saw a newcomer and quickly asked, “Just back from the island?”
I had no time to hear a reply.

That night, I heard tapping on the wall in the rhythm of Morse code (“moóc”).
I did not know Morse, so I did not understand.
(At one interrogation, an American had grilled me on why, as an intelligence officer, I had not been trained in radio.)

I suspected this was a setup to test me.
If I had known Morse code but had concealed it in my statements, and now answered the tapping from the adjacent cell, they would use this “conversation” to expose me.
So I stayed silent.

The next morning, on my way to interrogation, I let the guard walk ahead.
As I passed the peephole of solitary cell No. 5, I quickly said: “Letter A, tap once; letter B, tap twice.”
Then I walked straight on.

That night, the prisoner in cell No. 5 began tapping exactly as I had suggested.
So the two of us were now able to “talk.”

But I still suspected he was a plant.

Moreover, by coincidence, at noon the next day the guards suddenly called me out for a haircut.
At the processing room where haircuts were done, as the barber was nearly finished, he asked: “You’re Thông, right?”
I was startled and replied, “I am Hợp.”
The guard snapped at him: “Hoàng Trí Thông is in the other cell.”
So I learned that man’s name.

Night after night, through halting tapping, we talked.
Piecing things together, I gathered this:

He asked my name and when I had been captured.
I answered in line with my fictitious statements, still wary of a trap.

He said his name was Thông; that he was from Công an vũ trang Yên Bái; that he had gone South to work in Mỹ Tho Province as An ninh đô thị; that he had been captured in a secret bunker with a weapon and therefore had claimed to be a Tỉnh đội officer.
He said that in Sài Gòn he had been held in a cell at the Bộ Tổng Tham mưu ngụy, and that due to urinary problems he had been sent to a hospital — though he did not know which one.
At this camp, he had not yet been interrogated.
A few days later, he said he had been questioned in a room along the side of the prison.

I found this strange.
My interrogations took place in a row of rooms I reached by crossing a courtyard.
How could his interrogation be in a room along the outside wall of this camp?

Seeing that I had been captured at the end of 1970, he asked about the situation outside.
I told him about the coup in Cambodia.

Each time we tapped, it took a long time to grasp each other’s meaning, and we often mis-tapped.

$ * * * $

Our troops entered Sài Gòn and freed me from the 3 Bạch Đằng prison at noon on 30 April 1975.

Afterward, when I reported to Bộ Công an, I told them about the man who called himself Thông, who had tapped on the wall to communicate with me in early 1971 at 3 Bạch Đằng, and whom I suspected of being an enemy agent.
I reasoned that the enemy had devised this plan so that, if I let down my guard and trusted this “fellow prisoner,” I might inadvertently reveal my true identity.

Bộ Công an investigated.
At Công an vũ trang Yên Bái there was indeed an officer named Thông.
But he had never gone South.

They continued checking, using the name of the wife and child that the “wall-tapper” had given me.
They eventually found another Công an vũ trang officer, a close friend of the real Thông.
This man had gone South, been captured, and defected — and had used the name Thông.

In the end, the traitor confessed that in early 1971, after surrendering, he had followed the enemy’s plan, tapping on the wall to talk with the prisoner in the next cell (me), to help them verify that prisoner’s statements.

Thus, in that unusual situation I experienced, this can be considered a “double victory” for me: both in a battle of wits and in counterintelligence.

$ * * * $

It is clear that, with unwavering revolutionary resolve, regardless of circumstances or place, anyone can still do useful work for the Tổ quốc and for the people.

$ * * * $

This match of minds, staged right inside the enemy’s prison at 3 Bạch Đằng in early 1971, had to wait until after 30 April 1975 — more than four years — before a “referee with sufficient authority” could officially declare the winner and the loser.

Perhaps even in international tournaments between chess grandmasters, no game has to wait that long.
