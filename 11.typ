= 11.  Stories About Tigers

By mid-1950,
French colonial forces finally carried out their plan
to push outward from the Hà Nội area
and occupy Phủ Lý and Vân Đình,
threatening what remained of the free zone
on the right bank of the Red River in Liên khu Ba.

Our Hà Nội agencies, then based in the districts of Ứng Hòa and Mỹ Đức
of Hà Đông Province,
had to withdraw temporarily toward Quốc lộ 21,
near Cầu Rậm and Chợ Bến.

At that time, we also faced the task
of merging three separate units
with similar functions,
all operating in the Hà Nội area.
We needed a relatively quiet place
to reorganize and arrange personnel,
so we temporarily moved into làng Mát.

Anyone who traveled from the lowlands up to Việt Bắc in those days
had to pass through Kim Bôi and Hạ Bì in Hòa Bình,
past places like Chợ Sồ, Sào, Rạnh…
Làng Mát lay along that vital route.

It was a small Mường hamlet,
remote and sparsely populated.
Some mornings, waking up,
we could see clearly
the tracks of a mother tiger and her cub
circling the stilt house.

Here, at night,
tigers sometimes came to snatch the pigs
kept under the houses.

Local people who went into the forest
had even encountered tigers
sitting calmly by the roadside.

People shared their own experience:
When going anywhere,
one should carry a bamboo or wooden pole
about two meters long on the shoulder;
if a tiger pounced,
the pole would catch in its mouth,
preventing it from biting the person.

Others said:
If, on the road, you come across a tiger
sitting like a statue at the forest’s edge,
and you run away in fear,
it will chase and attack.
But if you hold its gaze
until it turns its head away,
then walk on steadily,
it will not pursue you.

There was also a rumor:
Whenever fighting broke out
along Quốc lộ 21,
once the gunfire subsided,
a gray tiger would appear
to look for the bodies of the dead.

One night, while we were sleeping,
we heard a commotion in the hamlet—
the sound of gongs, pots, pans.
That was how the local people frightened tigers.
Bamboo torches glowed red.
Everyone clearly saw a gray tiger,
walking on three legs,
with a pig clamped under its remaining front leg,
running from a house up into the forest.

The next day,
our unit discussed ways
to help the villagers deal with the tiger.

A few handy comrades
collected bamboo
and built a small cage.
We had a small herd of goats,
so we chose a young one
and placed it inside the cage.
Then we went up the hill
to find a patch of dense cogon grass,
full of leeches—
a place tigers often passed.
We tied the cage securely to stakes in the ground
and rigged several grenades with pins removed,
expecting that when the tiger reached for the goat,
it would trigger the grenades.
Several of our best marksmen
braved mosquitoes and leeches
and lay in ambush.

Indeed, the gray tiger soon caught the scent.
It approached, cautiously observing.
Then it suddenly darted
from one side to the other
past the cage.
It moved so fast
that none of the marksmen
could follow it in their sights;
they fired blindly.

Just then,
the tiger lunged in
and grabbed the cage.

Grenades exploded loudly.
When the smoke cleared,
there was no tiger—
and the goat and cage
had vanished as well.

The tiger was too clever
and too fast
to be hit at all.

So all our effort was wasted—
we lost both bait and trap.

But our stories with tigers weren’t over yet.

At that time,
our unit—like many others—
used a military-style cover name.
The Thành đội,
which issued such designations,
was led then by Vỵ Hải.
He gave us the code name “Tiểu đoàn 30.”
He joked:
“People are afraid of you all—like they’re afraid of tigers.
So I’ll call you ‘30’.”
(“Ba mươi” is slang for “tiger.”)

Each morning and afternoon,
we assembled to salute the flag
and take roll call.

One evening, after dinner,
people drifted to the stream
to wash bowls and hands.
Suddenly a pistol shot rang out—
“đùng”—
followed by a tiger’s roar.

Everyone rushed toward the sound.
There was Chính,
coming from the far bank,
his face still tense.
He said he had just approached the stream
and found a gray tiger sitting there.
He was carrying a pistol,
so he drew it and fired once.
The tiger roared
and bolted up the hill
where the workhouse was
(and where many comrades slept).

It wasn’t time yet for the evening assembly,
but we quickly sounded the gong
to gather the unit
and check roll.
One man was missing: Ba.

People said
he hadn’t come down for dinner—
he must still be up at the house on the hill,
and perhaps had been attacked.

We ran up the hill.
The house was empty.
Around it, we found tiger tracks.
We circled the house and shouted his name,
but heard nothing.

We searched under the tables,
under the beds—
nothing.

Then faintly,
we heard a small trembling voice:

“A… ai… cứ… cứu… tô… tôi… với…”

The sound came from a roof beam.
Looking up,
we saw a lumpy chăn trấn thủ
on the beam.
When we called out,
the blanket shifted
and fell to the floor.
From inside emerged
Ba’s head—
his limbs shaking,
his face drained of color.

We helped him into a chair.
One hand still clutched the edge of the blanket.
The other hand trembled,
but between his thumb and forefinger
was a manh-xơ-lam—
a razor blade for shaving.

Once he had calmed down,
he told us:

He had been tidying his papers
before dinner
when he heard the gunshot
and the tiger’s roar.
Moments later
a gray tiger dashed past the house.

Alone and terrified,
he grabbed the chăn trấn thủ
and covered himself
so the tiger wouldn’t see him.
He didn’t dare hide under the table—
the tiger might sniff him out.

So he climbed a support post
and lay flat on a roof beam.

Still afraid the tiger might find him,
he prepared a way to defend himself.
He searched everything on him—
only the manh-xơ-lam was sharp enough.
So he held it tight.

Still puzzled, we asked:
“What were you planning to do
with that razor blade?”

Ba answered, still shaking:

“Để… nếu… có bị con hổ vồ…
thì mình dùng cái manh-xơ-lam này
thiến cái dái của nó.”

(“So… if the tiger attacked…
I’d use this razor blade
to cut off its balls.”)

$ * * * $

That night,
the entire “Tiểu đoàn 30”
held a session
to review the incident.

Every detail
of Ba’s plan
to “castrate the tiger”
was retold.

All we could do
was bow down
in both admiration
and helpless laughter.
