= How I first met Uncle Hồ


At that time
I was not yet nineteen.

In the Youth for _National Salvation unit
of Hoàng Diệu Citadel_#footnote[_Đoàn Thanh niên Cứu quốc thành Hoàng Diệu_]
(Hà Nội’s pre–August Revolution codename),
after the Japanese coup of March 9, 1945
I was admitted to the Indochinese Communist Party.

At dusk one evening,
while I was engrossed in work with my comrades,
Vũ Oanh came looking for me
at my lodging—against the usual rules
of secret communications.

He said it was urgent:
at first light the next morning
I was to set out for military training
in the resistance base area.

He handed me a poll-tax card#footnote[colonial tax identification under the French]
and a tiny strip of rolling paper
saying it was an introduction note.
He then briefed me on
the meeting place,
what to bring,
and how to respond on the road.

To be sent to train for fighting the Japanese—
what joy could compare!

That night I only had time
to hand my network over 
to another comrade,
go to a safehouse to borrow
an old brown peasant outfit,
a _nón lá_#footnote[Vietnamese traditional conical hat],
and gather a little money 
chipped in by the brothers.
That was all I had
for the journey to the base.


Guided by the couriers,
our group of several dozen
reached Vân village,
where our side was in control 
day and night.
Only then did we have the chance
to meet as a group.
The comrades chose An
(later known as Lê Vinh Quốc)
as leader in charge of liaison;
I was assigned deputy leader,
responsible for propaganda
and mass work along the route.
In the group were comrades
who are still in the army today,
such as Lê Ngọc Hiền.

We traveled by day,
rested by night,
slipping through forests
and wading streams,
until at last we reached Tân Trào.
The courier told us
to sit and rest under the banyan tree#footnote[The famous Tân Trào banyan, a landmark of the Việt Minh base area in 1945.]
and wait for senior cadre to arrive.

Seeing we had just come up
from the lowlands,
villagers gradually gathered
to ask questions.
I did as my assignment required.

As I was speaking,
an elderly man—indigo shirt
slung over one shoulder,
indigo trousers rolled to the knee—
came to listen,
then put many questions
for me to answer.
I told of the famine below,
of bodies along the roads
that I myself had seen;
I explained how the Japanese
had kicked out the French
yet continued to oppress
and exploit our people;
I spoke about the Việt Minh Front
and its national salvation policies.
He asked me:
“What have you young people
come here to do?”
I answered that we had come
for military training
to drive out the Japanese
and win independence
for our people.

From that exchange,
I remember his words exactly,
such as:
“Before the French came
to seize our country,
the people in the lowlands
were enslaved first,
those in the mountains after.
Now it is independent up here first;
in time the people down below
will be independent too.”


A representative from higher up
came to meet us:
an old felt cap on his head,
a suit jacket of cloth
dyed with black,
trousers rolled to the knee,
bare feet;
most striking of all,
a leather shoulder strap
and a large pistol at his hip.

He introduced himself as Văn.
He asked about our route,
our health,
warned us about malaria,
and told us to wait a few days
before beginning training.
Among us were comrades
who had lived in Hà Nội
and recognized him
as Võ Nguyên Giáp#footnote[Võ Nguyên Giáp (1911–2013) 
was Vietnam’s preeminent military commander and strategist—the 
architect of the 1954 Điện Biên Phủ victory over France and a key 
leader of the People’s Army in the wars against the United 
States—later serving as defense minister and statesman.].

After the group meeting,
Văn spoke privately
with An and me,
giving instructions.
In that narrow conversation,
we told him
that some comrades
knew his real name.
Văn told us
to remind anyone who knew
to keep it secret.

From then on,
every couple of days,
the two of us would go
to Mr. Tiến Sự’s house
to report our work to Văn.

On the first evening in Tân Trào,
during our unit’s nightly session
reviewing the day’s work,
I relayed the old villager’s remarks;
we concluded among ourselves
that in the base area
the people’s understanding was high—
perhaps even higher
than in the lowlands.

One day we went to cut palm leaves
for roofing.
I carried my bundle back first
and was resting
when a comrade hurried in,
grabbed my arm,
and whispered something strange:
to shorten his path
he had slipped behind
Mr. Tiến Sự’s house
and had seen the  
very old man
I had spoken to on our first day
talking with Văn.
He even overheard the man say:
“You fellows are doing that
in a very foolish way.”

At the time
we regarded Văn
as the highest-ranking cadre
there so this was very strange.


Let me also add:
in my family many had long been
active in the revolution;
my uncle and my brother
were in prison.
So I had vaguely heard the name
Nguyễn Ái Quốc#footnote[Alias of Hồ Chí Minh.],
along with rumors
that he had died of tuberculosis.

After hearing what was overheard
at Mr. Tiến Sự’s house,
I spoke with An
and insisted that only someone
like Nguyễn Ái Quốc
would dare speak that way
to Văn.
We agreed to find a way
to test our hunch.

At our next regular session
with Văn,
just before leaving,
we said there was
a secret matter to report.
He permitted it.
I began: “About the old man…”
The moment he heard that,
Văn lifted a finger to his lips,
signaling me to stop.
Without answering,
he told the two of us:
“Let it be just between you two—
don’t spread it further.”

He gave no confirmation—
and yet it was as good
as an answer.

My heart pounded.
That night I lay awake,
tears streaming.
I thought of my uncle and brother
still in prison.

I whispered to myself:
if Cụ Nguyễn Ái Quốc
has returned to the country,
the revolution will surely triumph;
the day I see my loved ones again
is not far.

Later, recalling that scene,
I understood that Bác
was immersing himself
among the people
to grasp the real situation
and gauge their understanding.

But I also tell myself:
had I known, under that banyan,
that he was the leader
who founded the Party,
the teacher of Việt Nam’s revolution,
I would never have dared
to speak so boldly,
while still so naive,
in front of Him.
