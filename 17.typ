= 17. Protecting Bác Hồ on His Visits to Southeast Asia

In 1958, Bác Hồ visited India and Burma (now Myanmar).
In early 1959, Bác visited Indonesia.

Knowing Bác’s temperament, Prime Minister Nehru instructed the Protocol Department of the Indian Ministry of Foreign Affairs that no rigid ceremonial procedures would work on Ho Chi Minh.
And indeed, that was true.

During the visit to Nehru’s private residence, on the way back to the Presidential Palace (where Bác was staying), the motorcade suddenly stopped.
No one understood what had happened.
Then they saw Bác step out of the car, right in the middle of the street.
This stretch of road was not far from the back gate of the Presidential Palace.
And so Bác simply walked.
Indian people along the road poured out to greet and cheer him.
Upon reaching the back gate, Bác walked straight in, passed the canvas tents of the Indian guard units, and turned aside to visit them.
The guards were completely taken by surprise.
Everyone was deeply moved by Bác’s attention.
The unit commander, his eyes almost welling with tears, said to a cadre of our delegation:
“Truly great, and yet truly simple.”

In New Delhi, there was an ancient tower of considerable height.
Our security staff inspected it beforehand and found that reaching the top required climbing roughly a hundred worn and narrow steps.
Even healthy people would feel exhausted.
So when Bác arrived, they suggested he only observe from below.
But Bác brushed it aside and said that having come, he should climb all the way up—slowly would be fine.
And Bác began his ascent.

At the top, Bác stepped out onto the viewing platform.
Down below, a large crowd of Indians had gathered after learning that President Ho Chi Minh was visiting the tower.
From above, Bác waved.
The cheers erupted loudly.

When Bác descended, our security staff worried constantly he might slip.
The steps were narrow, and there was no way to support him safely.
So one person went ahead to receive him from below, and another followed behind.
But Bác simply said, “Don’t worry. I can manage.”

Eventually, Bác reached the ground.
The Indian crowd surged in to greet him again, cheering until the motorcade finally drove away from the area.

At a public meeting, Bác readily answered questions.
Someone asked: “What does it mean to reunify Vietnam by peaceful means?”
Bác answered immediately:
“It means that Vietnamese from both the North and the South sit down together to discuss the affairs of the country.”
The audience burst into applause.

At a press conference, the number of reporters exceeded the organizers’ expectations, so there were not enough chairs.
Bác asked everyone to move the chairs aside.
Then Bác sat directly on the floor and told the reporters to do the same.
That way, everyone had a place to sit.
The reporters laughed happily—Bác’s spontaneous idea satisfied everyone.
The press conference happened in this manner, something never before seen in the world for a head of state.

In Burma, visitors to the Shwedagon Pagoda, and in Indonesia, visitors to Borobudur Temple, all had to remove their shoes.
Most people spent a long time untying their shoes and socks.
Bác, wearing his usual rubber sandals from home, slipped them off instantly.
Reporters traveling with the delegation seized the rare moment to photograph and film Bác’s sandals—both the sandals themselves and the way he removed and put them back on.
No other head of state in the world had sandals like these.

During the visit to Indonesia, right after arriving in Jakarta and before any official program began, Bác asked to tour the city incognito.
The Indonesian side had assigned three military officers—one from the Navy, one from the Army, one from the Air Force—to accompany him.
But Bác said he needed only one, so the Air Force lieutenant colonel took him.
While passing a canal in the capital, they happened to see a man relieving himself in the open.
Bác saw this; the lieutenant colonel turned red with embarrassment.
But Bác immediately remarked, in essence, that developing a country in all aspects required immense effort and time.
The lieutenant colonel later wrote a memoir-style piece recounting this, expressing his deep emotion at Bác’s understanding, saying Bác’s words erased all his embarrassment.

Also in Indonesia, when visiting the port city of Surabaya, after an exhausting program and a late-night banquet and performance, the hosts urged Bác to rest.
But Bác wished to make a quiet visit to the residence of the local Islamic Sultan.
The hosts were caught off guard, but since it was the guest’s request, they arranged it.
They called for the security team and escort cars, but Bác refused, saying only one vehicle was needed.
They had no choice but to comply.

Thus, in a single car, Bác sat in the back with the Indonesian Air Force lieutenant colonel as guide and interpreter; one of our security officers sat beside them; and in the front seat, along with the driver, two of our security cadres squeezed into one seat.
The car drove a long, winding route until they reached a walled compound—the residence of the Sultan.
It was past midnight when they returned.

The next morning, Bác and the delegation continued their schedule, flying on to visit Bali.
