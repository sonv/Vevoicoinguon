= 20. Going South on the unnumbered ships

In the 1960s, I was a member of the Đảng đoàn Bộ Công an, directly serving as Director of the Cục Bảo vệ chính trị (that is, An ninh chính trị).

After the Mặt trận Dân tộc giải phóng miền Nam Việt Nam was established and the need to develop many fields of work increased, the Bộ Công an began training special classes of officers to send to the South.
At that time, the Phòng Phái khiển — precursor of today’s Cục Tình báo Công an — was still placed under the department I headed.
A specialized section serving the South began to take shape.

$ * * * $

One day, anh Hoàn — then the Minister — told me to draft a set of guidelines on intelligence work for the Đảng bộ in the South, for the Party Central Committee to send in.
I felt that since we had no government apparatus in the South, and mass mobilization was still the primary task, the people’s viewpoint had to be emphasized.
The draft I gave anh Hoàn, as far as I remember, was approved without revision.
A short while later, anh Hoàn told me that the Party Central Committee had already sent it to the Đảng bộ in the South.

Later, when I went to the South to work and met the comrades in charge of that field, I heard them mention that document.
They said it had been very helpful in guiding local work.
Privately, I was pleased to have contributed something useful to the movement in the South.
Of course, I did not say that I had helped shape the content of that document.

To return to the Ministry’s special training classes for An ninh officers going to the South.
I recall that the first classes were intended to supply cadres for Khu 5.
To maintain secrecy, the organizing comrades borrowed several rooms in the collective housing of the city’s Sanitation Company, on the road from Ô Chợ Dừa toward Thành Công, near today’s Hoàng Cầu.
The access road was foul-smelling; few would imagine that a secret class was held inside.
I went to give lectures there, and at the closing session, several Khu ủy 5 comrades also attended.

Around the fourth quarter of 1963, I joined the Vietnamese delegation in border talks with the Chinese side.
The meeting took place in Nam Ninh, Guangxi, China.

Our delegation was led by đồng chí Nguyễn Quang Việt, Deputy Minister of Public Security and Political Commissar of the Công an vũ trang.
Included were the Directors of Public Security and the Chiefs of Staff of the Military Regions bordering China.
From the central level were the Deputy Chief of Staff of the Công an vũ trang and myself from the Ministry of Public Security.

The Chinese delegation was led by Li Tianyou, Deputy Chief of Staff of the People’s Liberation Army, with representatives from the Guangdong, Guangxi, and Yunnan Military Regions, as well as the Navy Command.
It should be noted that shortly before the talks, we had captured an entire commando group from Taiwan, aided by Ngô Đình Diệm’s agents, who had landed on the Trà Cổ coast of Hải Ninh intending to enter the Thập Vạn Đại Sơn region of China.
We captured them and handed them over to China, so the Chinese side was particularly interested in the cooperation and assistance we had provided.

The talks ended.
On November 1, 1963, our delegation waited for the international through-train from Beijing passing Nam Ninh to return home.
While waiting to go to the station, some comrades in the delegation turned on the radio to listen to the news.
Suddenly, the broadcast announced that the coup to overthrow Ngô Đình Diệm had succeeded.
Everyone began talking excitedly, all in good spirits.
As for me, I thought a great deal about the changes taking place in the South.

$ * * * $

The next day, we arrived in Hà Nội.
It was a Saturday.
I stopped by anh Hoàn’s house to tell him about the talks, though it was not yet the delegation’s formal report.
My house was right next to his.
My working relationship with anh Hoàn had always been close — not only in the Ministry of Public Security, but from the days of the resistance against the French, when we were in the Thành ủy Hà Nội.

During our conversation, we spoke about the situation in the South.
I told anh Hoàn that perhaps the time had come for me to go directly to the South to work.
Anh Hoàn also seemed interested in my thought, but said he would report to the Ban Bí thư first.
I understood his hesitation.

I was then a member of the Đảng đoàn Bộ, directly serving as Director of the Cục Bảo vệ chính trị.
In that position, I not only held many secrets of the Party and the State, but at that time I had also successfully directed many operations that had never been done before.
Moreover, the Mỹ–ngụy forces were sending many commandos to the North, and I was directing the struggle effectively.
If I went South, it would be useful — but who would replace me?

I suggested to anh Hoàn that anh Viễn Chi could take my place.

A few days later, anh Hoàn met me privately.
He told me that the group of Politburo comrades in charge of the South had received my proposal.
They were glad and considered it very valuable.
They instructed anh Hoàn to keep it secret and arrange everything quickly.
Later on, I came to understand the Politburo’s strategic thinking about the possibility that the enemy’s “special war” might fail, and that we had to take advantage of the moment.

At a meeting of the Đảng đoàn Bộ, anh Hoàn raised the matter, and everyone agreed.

I continued directing daily work, but at the same time prepared to hand over to anh Viễn Chi — not only immediate tasks, but also long-term plans for each area of work.
As I recall, the handover between us took about a week, perhaps a little more.

$ * * * $

Anh Phạm Hùng had known me for a long time.
One day he called me over and told me he would brief me on the Resolution regarding the South.
He also said that he was arranging my trip, since he was responsible for that matter.
According to anh Phạm Hùng, I would go by sea.
It would be faster than walking along the Trường Sơn, which would take too long.
Later I learned that anh Trần Văn Trà and Lê Đức Anh were also arranged to go by sea.
Anh Phạm Hùng said he was choosing a vessel with plenty of experience.
As for the timing, that depended on the movements of the U.S. Seventh Fleet, which was spreading out to control the Gulf of Tonkin.

$ * * * $

Thinking about the many rivers and waterways in the South, and knowing that my swimming was poor, I decided I had to remedy this weakness.
In the Cục Bảo vệ chính trị there was anh Hồng, nicknamed Hồng Sáu because he had six children.
He was a strong swimmer and had known me since 1945.
I told anh Hồng privately and asked him to keep it secret.

During the bitter winter days, he took me to the Quảng Bá swimming pool.
There he coached me — not only standing on the bank, but getting into the water with me.

I suddenly remembered a time during the resistance against the French, one cold December night in the rain, when anh Đức Việt, who handled giao liên, guided me into inner Hà Nội.
We had to wade across the Chiếc bridge river, freezing to the bone.

This time too, on terribly cold days, we went to train.
After each session, anh Hồng came back to my house, and we recovered with a glass of sugar water and a few butter biscuits — which, at that time, was already quite good.

It should also be said that comrades preparing to go South usually stayed together, eating and resting under a special regime.
For me, to keep the secret, I continued living at home and maintained normal routines.

$ * * * $

In the Ministry, there was anh Chín Kiềm, who had worked in Công an in Sài Gòn during the resistance against the French and now oversaw support for the South.
He prepared everything for me with a kind of care I can never forget.
All supplies were kept at his office.

Knowing I would travel by sea, anh Kiềm built several metal containers and packed into them high-quality radio sets we had seized from enemy commandos, medicines, and even books for the comrades in the South.
He said that once inside, traveling by small boats, weight would not matter.

In truth, when we arrived, the heavy items had to be sent by giao liên along a separate route.
And I still struggled with my own bag like anyone else.

$ * * * $

One time, anh Phạm Hùng asked me to come to his house.
Only then did I learn that he was ill.
Lying on his bed, he briefed me on the Resolution of the Central Committee and the Politburo regarding the Southern Revolution.
One point struck me: even then, he told me that we might be able to capture and hold Sài Gòn.
It was not until the Mậu Thân 1968 campaign that I realized this had been a long-considered strategic idea.

After waiting a long time without being able to depart, I once suggested to anh Phạm Hùng that he allow me to go by land.
But he firmly refused.

Seeing that departure before Tết was unlikely, anh Phạm Hùng told me to stay calm, celebrate Tết, and we would arrange matters afterward.

$ * * * $

As for my family, I was allowed to tell them the truth — except the small children.
My parents were very sad and worried, because my older brother had already fallen during the resistance against the French.
But they still agreed that I should go South.

At that time, my parents were living in Võng Thị village near chợ Bưởi.
The whole family still gathered to celebrate Tết, though each of us silently felt that this might be the last Tết together for an unknown time.

On New Year’s Eve that year, our daughter Hòa Bình — our first child — was ten years old.
She usually lived with her grandparents and attended the village school.
That day she stayed with my wife and me at our quarters inside the Ministry, and we took her out to walk around Hồ Gươm to welcome the New Year.

I still remember that my father, returning from an overseas trip, had brought Hòa Bình a pair of leather shoes — something rare for children at the time.
But the shoes were a little big.
Walking for long would hurt her feet, yet she wanted to wear them for Tết.
So I softened some paper and stuffed the toes to make them fit.

She enjoyed that walk so much, feeling as though she were already grown up.
She had no way of knowing that this was the last night she would go out with her father before a separation whose end we could not foresee.
To her, it was only joy — especially when, on the way back, we met her maternal grandfather by chance at a phở stall.

At Lunar New Year of 1964, my parents were still living in Võng Thị village.
The whole family gathered for Tết, but everyone knew that after the holiday I would certainly leave.
In the courtyard, the entire family assembled.
My parents sat on chairs; my sister and her husband, my wife, my sister’s four sons, our two daughters, and two sons all stood around them.
I set the camera on automatic mode and ran into place.
That photograph still exists today.

During Tết, anh Long — Director of Public Security of Hà Nội, who had earlier worked in the South — came to Võng Thị to see me and invited my wife and me for a meal.
We accepted.
At his house, he said that although the Ministry kept things secret, he knew I was about to go South, so the meal was meant as a farewell.
After the meal, perhaps because the liquor was too strong, my wife suddenly fell ill and had to stay in the hospital.
Knowing I would soon depart, she was worried she would not be home when the time came; she later had to find a way to give the hospital a false explanation so she could be discharged.

I myself went into the hospital to have my tonsils removed, but because there was a cadre conference to study Resolution 9 of the Central Committee, I was released early.
Listening in the main hall was fine, but when it came time for small-group discussion, I still could not speak; when I tried, my voice was unclear.

$ * * * $

Several times I had been told to get ready to leave, and each time it was postponed at the last moment.
Anh Phạm Hùng had to stay in the hospital because one of his legs showed signs of atrophy, smaller than the other.
I often came to visit him and ask about the trip.
Anh Phạm Hùng told me that the transport group had been selected, but we were waiting for a moment when the U.S. Seventh Fleet loosened its patrols in the Gulf of Tonkin, and we would go immediately.

One evening, I was told to go to anh Lê Duẩn’s house.
During most of the meeting, anh Lê Duẩn spoke and gave instructions.
Besides matters relating to the Ministry of Public Security, he also gave messages for me to convey to the Trung ương Cục.

The Đảng đoàn Bộ Công an held a farewell meal, with my wife present.

One evening, the Ban Bí thư invited me to dinner.
Present were anh Lê Đức Thọ and anh Lê Toàn Thư — the comrades responsible for cadre work for the South.
My family also attended: my wife and I, my parents, and my uncle Lê Văn Lương.

When I told this to anh Phạm Hùng in the hospital, he said that he had informed the Ban Bí thư that such a gathering was necessary, because in the Ministry of Public Security I was, up to that point, the highest-ranking person ever sent to the South.

$ * * * $

At last, I was told to make final preparations, and this time it was certain.

Within the Ministry, I had completed my handover to anh Viễn Chi.
We had already spread the story that I was preparing to go for long-term study in the Soviet Union.
In my family, we agreed to use the same explanation for my children, in case they were still too young and might accidentally reveal something.
The comrades in the Cục Bảo vệ chính trị likely guessed the truth, but according to secrecy rules, no one said anything; still, they looked at me in a way that showed they understood.

One noon break — in those days we did not work through lunch as people often do now — the deputy directors of my department asked me to stay at the office.
There were anh Sanh Châu (now deceased), anh Sỹ Huynh, and anh Kim Tấn.
They said that because of secrecy they could not all go somewhere together to give me a farewell meal, so they brought cold dishes to the office instead.

The departure date was set for 21 March 1964.

I went to the hospital to visit and say goodbye to anh Phạm Hùng.
He embraced me and, with tears in his eyes, told me to try my best to adapt quickly to the situation in the South.
At that moment, I did not imagine that he himself would one day also go South.

$ * * * $

On the afternoon of 20 March 1964, my parents came from Võng Thị to my quarters at the Ministry and stayed the night.
The next day, my sister and her husband also gathered at our home.
My children were allowed to stay home from school and be with me.
At the farewell lunch that day, my mother cooked sour fish soup — my favorite — but no one wanted to eat.

At noon on 21 March 1964, after resting a bit, it was time to leave.

My youngest son, Cu Đại, whom I often spoiled, refused to leave my side; perhaps something warned him that the adults were not telling him the truth.

When the moment came, I embraced and kissed each member of my family.
My father, his voice trembling, said only one sentence: “Go, my son.”

Since the cover story was that I was going to the Soviet Union, and since that day was Saturday, when the weekly international train departed, Cu Đại guessed that I would have to go out through the Ministry gate.
He threw the ball he had been playing with out the window into the courtyard.
Then, despite the adults trying to stop him, he ran down the stairs to wait for me at the Ministry gate.
I came down the stairway.
My heart ached for him, because I was not going out through the gate.

I crossed over to anh Hoàn’s house.
Passing the Ministry hall, I saw that people were listening to the news.
At anh Hoàn’s house the comrades of the Đảng đoàn Bộ were already gathered, along with anh Chín Kiềm.

Traveling South with me on that trip was anh Nguyễn Hoàn, Deputy Chief of Staff of the Công an vũ trang.

Two passenger cars were already waiting.
Our belongings had been loaded.

One by one, anh Hoàn and then each comrade in the Đảng đoàn Bộ — those who had worked side by side with me since the Đảng đoàn Bộ Công an was formed in 1957 — took commemorative photos with me.
Each of them embraced me before we parted.
From the window of my house, looking over toward anh Hoàn’s, my family watched as well.
By then, little Đại had gone back home.
I waved to my family one more time.

We got into the car at about two in the afternoon.
Anh Ngô Ngọc Du, then Deputy Minister in charge of Organization, and anh Nguyễn Quang Việt, Deputy Minister and Political Commissar of the Công an vũ trang, got in to see us off.

$ * * * $

Our first stop was on what is now Lý Nam Đế Street, to contact the unit in charge of the sea route.
Once it was certain that the trip would not be postponed, we set off for Hải Phòng.
At dusk we stopped in Hải Dương for dinner, then continued.

Reaching Hải Phòng, we went to the Hải quân Command.
After waiting there a while, we went on to Đồ Sơn.
There we met three army officers assigned to travel on the same ship with me.
Anh Du and anh Việt stayed behind, giving me a final embrace before we parted.

We used vehicles from the Hải quân Command to go out to Đồ Sơn.

The car went straight to the jetty.
The ship’s engine was already running.

As soon as we had brought our things aboard, the ship set off.

$ * * * $

The ship we traveled on was a steel vessel.
According to what anh Phạm Hùng had told me, it had only recently begun operating.
Its tonnage was probably around one hundred tons, used for transporting weapons.
Only specially assigned personnel traveled with it.

Our quarters were in a compartment at the stern; up front was the weapons hold, followed by the command area.

The captain met us and laid down secrecy rules: we were not to ask each other’s names and would address one another by rank order in the family.
The ship posed as a fishing boat.
If inspected, it had arms for self-defense; and if exposed, we were to blow it up as a last resort.

The crew warned us that we would get seasick and that vomiting was normal, but that we had to try to eat — as much as we could manage — to regain strength.

The ship followed the route along international waters.
The sea that day was at force 7, with waves sometimes washing over the deck.

No sooner had we left than everyone began retching.
We were laid low, only getting up when we had to go to the toilet.
We learned that on that trip it was not just we passengers who were ill — the whole crew was, except for the radio operator.

In a quiet moment, I asked about the crew’s situation and learned that when at base they received only ordinary rations, and it was only when going on a mission that they were given combat allowances.
I thought to myself that it really ought to be the reverse: at base they should be fed well, because on trips like this, whatever they ate they brought back up, leaving them with no strength for work, let alone combat.

Among the crew, I felt the most sympathy for the mechanic.
He was always down in the engine room.
Once I tried going down for just a few minutes and could not endure the lack of air and the heavy smell of oil.
To work in such conditions, and yet whenever a voyage ended safely and the ship returned to the North, the crew would load the vessel with mangrove firewood and dried fish to help units in the North improve their living conditions.

When I reached the South, I immediately wrote a letter to be carried back by ship to the North, pointing out this unreasonable policy.
I remember suggesting that policy officials should be sent to make one or two voyages so they could set regulations that fit reality, instead of sitting at desks and issuing impractical rules.
I do not know whether my letter ever reached anyone or did anything to help the crew.

Once in the South, I heard about the Vũng Rô incident.
After 30 April 1975, I asked after the ship I had traveled on, whose captain the crew called Phước, and learned that he had died on a later voyage.
Years later, when I watched the film “Tiếng gọi của biển” on television, about the “tàu không số,” I could not hold back my tears.

Though we were in international waters, whenever we saw merchant ships or unknown vessels, we avoided them.
At night, when we encountered large ocean-going ships, ours felt like a person standing at the foot of a brightly lit high-rise building.
By day, looking out over the vast ocean, our ship was just a tiny dot.
Yet it still floated and still moved forward.

We endured the waves and wind for several days.
Then one day the captain announced that the sea was calm, force 3 or 4, and that we could come up on deck to sit.
I saw the crew take out their weapons and begin cleaning them.
When I asked, I was told that we had crossed the 17th parallel, though we were still in international waters.

After cleaning their weapons, the crew organized a bit of entertainment.
It was nothing fancy — some sang, others performed tuồng, or told stories and teased one another for laughs.
In the midst of such perilous conditions, they still kept a revolutionary optimism.
I was deeply moved and full of admiration for them.

Later, there was a comical story.
Some comrade had heard vaguely that I went South by sea and embellished it into a tale that I traveled by submarine, just like some far-fetched spy novel.
The reality of the Vietnamese revolution is that it was made up of deeds that were both simple and immensely great, carried out by very modest people — many of whom fully deserved to be called heroes.

$ * * * $

The ship kept going.
Then one night, as I lay half-asleep, I heard a strange rumbling sound.
When I asked, I was told there was a problem.

The crew worked over the engine and checked around the ship.
I will never forget the mechanic who spent hours down in the engine room that day.

The captain called a cell meeting, which we were invited to attend.
Only then did we learn that the ship’s “log” device had been bitten off by what was probably a very large fish.

Previously, I had thought that having a compass was enough for a sea-going vessel.
Now I understood that as a ship travels, waves and wind affect it.
You cannot simply read the speed off a dial and know how far the ship has gone.
Large ships have modern instruments for this, but on our vessel, to determine how far we had actually traveled and where we were, we had to rely on the “log” mounted under the water.

It was this failure of the log that caused complications for our ship, and led to unexpected situations in my later work in the South.

Our ship’s mission was to land at a harbor in Trà Vinh.

The first mishap was that instead of passing outside Lý Sơn Island, we went between the island and the mainland.

One morning, estimating that we had reached the waters off Nam Bộ, we saw a ship in the distance flashing signal lamps to question us.
The captain ordered that we not reply and turned the ship back out toward international waters to avoid the unknown vessel.

It turned out that instead of passing outside Côn Đảo, we had mistakenly gone between Côn Đảo and Vũng Tàu.
The ship that had signaled us may well have been an enemy patrol vessel.

Under the scorching sun, the ship kept moving.
When the other vessel was out of sight, we held another cell meeting.
The captain and most of the crew believed it would be difficult to reach the Trà Vinh harbour exactly.
So that night they would still try to find the correct inlet, but at the same time send a radio message to the North to report the ship’s situation and ask permission to land at Rạch Gốc in Cà Mau, a harbour they knew well, guided by the Hòn Khoai lighthouse.

That night, we tried to approach Trà Vinh.
In the dark, all we could see along the shore was a long black band, likely a line of coconut trees.
But how could we tell it from the coast of Bến Tre?
The captain decided to turn back out to sea and wait for instructions.

Once again, we faced a tense day on the open ocean, waiting both for nightfall and for orders.

Finally, a coded message arrived, approving entry at Rạch Gốc.

$ * * * $

The ship headed further south, still waiting for darkness.

After calculating the time, the captain ordered a course toward the shore, with orders to watch carefully for the Hòn Khoai lighthouse.

Night fell.
The ship was close to land, but the Hòn Khoai light was still not visible.
Some crew members wondered if we had mistakenly entered the mouth of the Sông Hậu.

As we drew nearer to shore, the ship suddenly ran aground.
The tide was still low, not yet rising.
The crew used poles and even got into the water to sound the depth.
The captain ordered that we find a way to back out to deeper water in case we ran into the enemy.

After much effort — and probably with the help of the rising tide — the ship was able to turn, its bow pointing out of the muddy water.
Gradually, it worked its way back to the open sea.

Barely a kilometer out of the shallows, the crew suddenly shouted with joy: they could see the light of Hòn Khoai.

It turned out that the spot where we had gone aground was shielded by a spit of land that had blocked the lighthouse from view.
Now we were sure.
Everyone felt relieved and cheerful.
It had been a real fright.

The ship continued on, with steady hearts.

Late that night, the captain ordered us to sail close to the shore to make it easier to find Rạch Gốc, the intended harbour.

After following the coastline for some time, we suddenly saw lights from inland, flashing green and red irregularly.
Clearly these were signals from the reception team.

The captain ordered the ship’s signal lamp to reply.

After that, since he knew the harbour well, the captain directed the ship to turn into what looked like a clump of trees.

In fact, it was a small creek just wide enough for the ship, with dense foliage overhead that blocked the bright moonlight that had shone on us when we were still at sea.

The ship slowed and then stopped.

A small boat came alongside, and we dropped a rope ladder so its occupants could climb aboard.
It turned out to be an acquaintance — a man the crew called anh Ba Cụt, because he had lost one arm.
Later someone told me that anh Ba Cụt had once sailed north with the leaders, unable to endure the repression of the Ngô Đình Diệm regime, and had gone to ask the Central Committee for armed struggle.
Now he was back in his native region, in charge of the harbour, receiving ships carrying weapons to support the Southern movement.

After some conversation, anh Ba Cụt told us that our ship had given the wrong signal and should by rights have been fired on.
But seeing that the ship’s profile matched ours, the shore team had held their fire and waited to see who we were.
Another close call.
We did not understand how the radio communications had been handled, because our ship had definitely been cleared in advance to use that harbour.

Anh Ba Cụt said that another ship was also expected that night, so it should be arriving soon.

Indeed, not long afterward, a second ship came in.

Later, when I reached Khu 9, I learned that the ship arriving after ours was carrying anh Lê Đức Anh.
That ship had left ahead of us but, for some reason, had to stop en route, so it departed earlier yet arrived later.

In the end, both ships reached their destination.
The voyage took about seven or eight days.

The harbour comrades took us to our lodgings, while forces were mobilized to unload the weapons.

Our temporary shelter consisted of huts built on mangrove trees.
To go from one hut to another, we had to cross “monkey bridges” made from mangrove trunks.

The comrades prepared fish meals for us.
In the North at that time fish had to be bought with ration coupons, and getting fish to eat did not mean eating freely.
Seeing so much fish on the table, I asked if this was a special treat for guests, since there was more than we could finish.
They laughed and said that here every day was like that; one only had to set nets and collect them to have enough fish.

At night, even with the mosquito net tucked in carefully, we still woke up bitten.
Once I noticed that the comrade sleeping next to me had his elbow resting right against the net, and there hung a whole “apple of mosquitoes” clinging to the netting at that spot.
It turned out that the first mosquito landed on his arm, the next one landed on the first, and so on, each continuing to suck blood until they formed a cluster the size of an apple.
Only then did I truly understand what people meant by “Cà Mau mosquitoes.”

I also suffered from what people call “land seasickness.”
Whether sitting, lying, or standing, I felt the world pitching and rolling as if I were still on the ship.
It took several days before things steadied.

$ * * * $

Over the next eleven years of living and working in Nam Bộ, I gradually came to understand this beloved region of our country more fully.

But I have never forgotten the images from that first time I set foot on the southernmost tip of the country — a land of deep suffering and great heroism, and also of many legends.

A new phase of struggle in my revolutionary life began there.

$ * * * $

After 30 April 1975, it was not until 1990 that I had a chance to return to Cà Mau.
The Bí thư Tỉnh ủy Minh Hải then was anh Tư Hườn.
Back in 1984, he and I had attended a course on economic management together at the Academy of National Economy in Moscow.
He arranged for someone to take me to Năm Căn.
At that time, the road from Cà Mau to Năm Căn had not yet been completed, so we still had to go by motorboat, which took nearly half a day.

Năm Căn had changed greatly compared with 1964, when I first arrived there.

A cannery had been built.
Many shrimp ponds had been formed.
But sadly, the mangrove forests had been devastated.
The endless, dense mangrove stands were gone.

The district comrades helped me get back to Rạch Gốc.

There, the situation with shrimp and mangroves was similar to what I had seen along the way.

Along the canals, houses stood close together.
Large fish traps and nets were spread out in even greater numbers than before, since people could now make a living openly without hiding as they had under the Mỹ–ngụy regime.
Television antennas were everywhere.

Near the trụ sở of the xã People’s Committee, a cải lương troupe was hanging a banner for its upcoming performance.

Comrades in the Đảng ủy and the People’s Committee told me they were preparing to erect a statue right there of thầy giáo Ngọc Hiển, the Communist teacher who had led the uprising to seize Hòn Khoai.

They took me to visit the home of đồng chí Hai Dĩa, who had been in charge of the Rạch Gốc harbour in 1964, and had welcomed many ships carrying weapons to the South — including the ship that first brought me to the beloved South, at the Đất Mũi, the country’s furthest point.

Anh Hai had passed away.
Chị Hai received me and reminisced about old times.
I lit incense at his family altar.

$ * * * $

Images from twenty-six years earlier came back vividly to me.

Đồ Sơn, Rạch Gốc, the Hồ Chí Minh trail at sea, the unnumbered ships, Captain Phước, the mechanic whose name I never learned, the crew of the ship I traveled on, and so many other fighters I never had the chance to know.
Who had survived, and who had fallen?

$ * * * $

In any case, for the rest of my life I will always remember those people.
And I will never forget that one journey in my life.

On the twentieth anniversary of the liberation of the South
Hà Nội, 6 January 1995

(1) Cầu Chiếc Bridge crosses the Nhuệ River in Hiền Giang Commune, Thường Tín, Hà Nội, linking national highway 21B with national highway 1A.
