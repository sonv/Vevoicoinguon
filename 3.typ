= Where are the _rươi_#footnote[_Rươi_: seasonal tidal ragworms used as a Northern Vietnamese delicacy.]?

Perhaps it’s the same in any family:
when the head of a household 
has a favorite dish,
everyone else tends to pick up
the habit—and the taste.

I don’t know from which generation,
but in our Nguyễn clan
certain foods have been handed down
from long ago to my father’s time,
and then to ours.

Every year the family must make
_mắm tôm chua_#footnote[_Mắm tôm chua_: a Huế-style fermented shrimp relish, pleasantly sour, spicy, and aromatic.]
and _mắm rươi_#footnote[_Mắm rươi_: a fermented paste made from _rươi_.].

"Sour, spicy, salty, astringent,
with pork belly"
pretty much sums up the prep
for _mắm tôm chua_.

But _mắm rươi_ is indescribable.
Not to mention the making of the paste itself—
you first have to buy the _rươi_
in season:
“the twentieth of the ninth month,
the fifth of the tenth”
on the lunar calendar each year.
Nor are we even talking yet about
eating it raw as relish,
or steamed into a custard—
and if you steam it,
you must do it right.
Just the fresh-herb platter alone
already runs to many kinds:
cabbage,
mustard greens,
celery,
chrysanthemum greens#footnote[_Rau cải cúc_ (also called _tần ô_ or garland chrysanthemum/shungiku).],
aromatic herbs,
mandarin peel,
slivered scallion,
and ginger.
Of course,
you still need pork belly.
Skip any of these
and the flavor falls short.

From before the August Revolution#footnote[The 1945 August Revolution in Vietnam.]
my father had already loved
these two kinds of _mắm_.
At ordinary meals he didn’t drink,
but whenever there was _mắm_,
he insisted on a few cups
of rice liquor.

On _mắm_ days the family
lingered at the table
longer than usual,
yet we always finished
before my father.
He took his time,
and at the very end
he would inevitably haul out
the whole lot of colonial officials--French and Vietnamese--and give them a thorough scolding
to conclude the meal.
By that sequence we could always tell
whether his _mắm_ meal
was nearing its end.

Still, perhaps because the family
didn’t drink,
it felt almost like eating alone;
so he never seemed as happy
as when close friends
came to share the _mắm_.

Of course, with friends present
there could be no end-of-meal
tirade against the officials.

After 1954, now and then
he would invite literary friends—
Tú Mỡ, Nguyên Hồng, Tô Hoài,
Nguyễn Huy Tưởng, Hoàng Trung Thông,
and others—to the house
to drink and eat _mắm_.
Once, after the meal,
they all lay down for a nap,
woke refreshed, then said their goodbyes,
each heading home.
Truly, those were cheerful
meals and drinks together.

Back in Nam Định, around 1937,
one afternoon my father told my mother:
a friend from faraway Sài Gòn
had just arrived and would join us
for dinner.
Asked if he could eat _mắm rươi_,
the friend said yes;
so serving our family’s traditional dish
would be just the thing.

With the late notice,
my mother hurried to Rồng Market
to buy provisions—assorted herbs and pork belly—
so the _mắm rươi_ could be ready
in time to welcome the guest.

By dusk my father’s Saigon friend arrived.
They ate and drank
for a little over an hour—
the meal nearly done, it seemed.

Suddenly the whole house heard
the Saigon friend call out loudly:
“Where are the _rươi_?”

Everyone burst into smiles,
though no one dared laugh aloud.

Because the _mắm rươi_
was already on the tray.
My father’s friend from Sài Gòn
had followed every step
just as my father did:
adding the condiments and _mắm rươi_
properly to his bowl;
and he had enjoyed the _mắm rươi_
from start to finish.

And yet here he was asking,
“Where are the _rươi_?”

It turned out
he had thought _mắm rươi_
meant there was still another dish yet to be served!

A hearty laugh was had by all.
