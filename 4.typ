= The Hardships of Schoolteacher–Writer Nguyễn Công Hoan

Speaking of the difficulties
the French colonial authorities
caused my father,
many people may only know
the episode of his novel _Bước Đường Cùng ("The Dead End")_
being banned in 1938.

In fact, the story cannot be understood
correctly if one isolates it
to that single incident.
While he was teaching in Nam Định,
my father was “punished” by
the colonial administration
and reassigned to teach
in the village of Trà Cổ,
Hải Ninh Province#footnote[Hải Ninh was an old province in northeastern Vietnam; today its area largely belongs to Quảng Ninh.];
that meant being sent "up-river" a second time—contrary to the
civil--service rules of that era--the first time having been Lào Cai.

This happened before the banning of _Bước Đường Cùng_.

In 1936, when the Popular Front#footnote[The French  government formed in 1936 under Léon Blum.]
came to power in France
and political prisoners in Việt Nam
were granted amnesty,
my father was teaching
at Cửa Bắc School
in the city of Nam Định.

Our family lived on Paul Doumer Street#footnote[Now Trần Hưng Đạo Street in Nam Định.]
facing Rồng Market.
At that time my uncle
Nguyễn Công Bông
and my elder brother
Nguyễn Tài Khoái
were studying in Nam Định
in the same class as
Phạm Văn Cương (Nguyễn Cơ Thạch)
and Phan Đình Đống (Mai Chí Thọ).

Thus I learned that Đống’s elder brother,
named Phan Đình Khải,
a political prisoner from Côn Lôn#footnote[Côn Lôn/Côn Lôn đảo: today Côn Đảo archipelago, used by the French as a penal colony.]
had just been released
and was living right in Nam Định.
Later, Khải took the name Lê Đức Thọ.

I saw Phan Đình Khải
come to visit my father.
But unlike other guests
who usually sat in the living room,
the two of them would each time
carry chairs out to the balcony
to talk.

Only later did I understand:
it was so that Khải could watch
whether any secret police
were tailing him.

That connection with
Phan Đình Khải at the time
was one of the factors
that led my father
to write _Bước Đường Cùng_.

Many have said that
my father was “transferred”
to Trà Cổ by the French
because _Bước Đường Cùng_
was banned.
In truth, the decision
to send him to Trà Cổ
had already been made
before he wrote
_Bước Đường Cùng_.
Therefore, the deeper cause was that 
the French colonial authorities
had begun to sense “a problem”—
something they had just detected
and deemed worthy
of close attention.
