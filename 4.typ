= The Hardships of Schoolteacher–Writer Nguyễn Công Hoan

Speaking of the difficulties
the French colonial authorities
caused my father,
many people may only know
the episode of his novel _Bước Đường Cùng ("The Dead End")_
being banned in 1938.

In fact, the story cannot be understood
correctly if one isolates it
to that single incident.
While he was teaching in Nam Định,
my father was “punished” by
the colonial administration
and reassigned to teach
in the village of Trà Cổ,
Hải Ninh Province#footnote[Hải Ninh was an old province in northeastern Vietnam; today its area largely belongs to Quảng Ninh.];
that meant being sent "up-river" a second time—contrary to the
civil--service rules of that era--the first time having been Lào Cai.

This happened before the banning of _Bước Đường Cùng_.

In 1936, when the Popular Front#footnote[The French  government formed in 1936 under Léon Blum.]
came to power in France
and political prisoners in Việt Nam
were granted amnesty,
my father was teaching
at Cửa Bắc School
in the city of Nam Định.

Our family lived on Paul Doumer Street#footnote[Now Trần Hưng Đạo Street in Nam Định.]
facing Rồng Market.
At that time my uncle
Nguyễn Công Bông
and my elder brother
Nguyễn Tài Khoái
were studying in Nam Định
in the same class as
Phạm Văn Cương (Nguyễn Cơ Thạch)
and Phan Đình Đống (Mai Chí Thọ).

Thus I learned that Đống’s elder brother,
named Phan Đình Khải,
a political prisoner from Côn Lôn#footnote[Côn Lôn/Côn Lôn đảo: today Côn Đảo archipelago, used by the French as a penal colony.]
had just been released
and was living right in Nam Định.
Later, Khải took the name Lê Đức Thọ.

I saw Phan Đình Khải
come to visit my father.
But unlike other guests
who usually sat in the living room,
the two of them would each time
carry chairs out to the balcony
to talk.

Only later did I understand:
it was so that Khải could watch
whether any secret police
were tailing him.

That connection with
Phan Đình Khải at the time
was one of the factors
that led my father
to write _Bước Đường Cùng_.

$ * * * $

Many have said that
my father was “transferred” to Trà Cổ by the French
because _Bước Đường Cùng_ was banned.
In truth, the decision to send him to Trà Cổ
had already been made before he wrote
_Bước Đường Cùng_.
The deeper cause was that the French colonial authorities
had begun to sense “a problem”—something they had just detected
and deemed worthy of close attention.

$ * * * $

In the early 1930s,
when I was only four or five, I sometimes heard the family mention
my fourth uncle, who had left home and vanished.

Some said that back in our village
he often shut himself in his room to study hypnosis.
After he disappeared, an acquaintance in the village reported
having glimpsed on a train to Sài Gòn
someone who looked like him--but in a flash he was gone.

Only when Phan Đình Khải
was released from prison and returned to Nam Định
did he tell my father news of my fourth uncle.


Arrested in Sài Gòn, my uncle gave only the name
Phạm Văn Khương, and said his family had all died.
(Later I came to understand this name:
my grandfather was Nguyễn Đạo Khang;
Khương is how Khang is pronounced
in the Southern accent—easy to remember
and an expression of affection for his family.)


My uncle was sentenced to death by a colonial court
for “communism and sedition.” Like Phạm Hùng,
though in a different case (the Nhà Bè affair).

Later, after denunciations in the book
_Indochine SOS_#footnote[_Indochine SOS_ (1935), reportage by French journalist André Viollis exposing brutal abuses in French Indochina.]
by the female communist journalist
André Viollis, and intervention by the
Red International, both Phạm Hùng and my uncle
had their sentences commuted to life imprisonment,
and were exiled to Côn Lôn.

Khải told us this that at Côn Lôn, when mail arrived,
other inmates would cheer, “Ah! I’ve got a letter!”
But my uncle--counted as having
no surviving family--never received any.
So once, just for a bit of fun, on mail day he suddenly cried out,
“Ah! I don’t have a letter!”
Hearing only the shout, friends rushed over, thinking
he’d finally heard from home, only to catch the punch line.

According to Khải, by that point it was no longer 
necessary to hide my uncle’s identity,
so he finally let our family know.

$ * * * $

Under the new policy of the French authorities,
and with Khải’s guidance, our family was thereafter able
to send letters to my uncle.
Using the name Phạm Văn Khương, my father noted his prisoner number
and the outside holding jail
associated with Côn Lôn on the underside of a stone frog
used as a paperweight.

Also likely following Khải’s advice,
our family roasted bran
and mixed it with molasses sending parcels to Côn Lôn
many times to help prisoners
suffering from beriberi#footnote[Beriberi: disease caused by  Vitamin B1 deficiency.].

Weeklies and monthlies could be sent,
but daily newspapers were not allowed.
Money could be sent as well, but the prison authorities
held it in custody, disbursing it to inmates
little by little.

Sometimes our family did receive letters from Côn Lôn.
“Letters,” in truth, were only a preprinted slip
with a few blank lines, just enough for the prisoner
to fill in the recipient’s address, report on his health,
and add a few words of greeting to the family.

$ * * * $

It was likely from that point that the French authorities realized that
the prisoner whose death sentence had been commuted to life,
known only by his own statement as Phạm Văn Khương
with “no surviving family,” was in fact the younger brother
of the schoolteacher–writer Nguyễn Công Hoan.

His real name was Nguyễn Công Miều
Later, after August 1945, he used the name Lê Văn Lương.

Which is to say that schoolteacher–writer
Nguyễn Công Hoan had a younger brother,
a “die-hard communist,” then imprisoned on Côn Lôn.

What’s more, former Côn Lôn political prisoner
Phan Đình Khải, residing in the city of Nam Định,
had visited our house many times.

And on top of that, schoolteacher–writer
Nguyễn Công Hoan had just joined the
French Socialist Party, Indochina branch,
in Nam Định, and had attended the May 1 rally,
the first to be held publicly at Hà Nội’s Exhibition Grounds.

Therefore, this person must be watched,
and handled with caution.

In my view, the foregoing story was the true, underlying reason that the
French colonial administration in Indochina resolved to “punish”
my father—both in his life as a writer and as a teacher.

$ * * * $

Thus the French colonial authorities forcing my father to go “up-river”
a second time—against the civil-service rules of the day—was not the end of it.

After a year in Trà Cổ,
they “transferred” him again,
this time to teach
in the town of Thái Bình.

In his very first year there,
French secret police searched our house
and arrested him that same afternoon.
They had found and seized a book,
_Stalin, the Man of Steel_,
which they claimed was banned.
He was released pending trial
so he could keep teaching in Thái Bình,
but he was simply waiting
for his day in court.

The French secret police expected
the Native Court in Thái Bình to convene
and sentence my father to prison.

Then something no one foresaw:
back during the Popular Front period,
guided by Phan Đình Khải,
my father had joined the
French Socialist Party,
Indochina branch,
in Nam Định.
Several French schoolteachers there
also belonged to the Socialist Party;
they were “Socialist comrades”
with my father.

They met him and learned
that his birth was registered in Hà Nội.
By law at the time,
anyone born in Hà Nội
could not be tried in the Native Court;
he had to be tried by the French Court,
which sat only in Hà Nội and Nam Định.

They then discovered that the “banned” book
was merely a Trotskyist#footnote[anti-Stalinist socialist current active in Indochina in the 1930s.]
publication attacking Stalin,
and in fact was being sold openly
in bookshops—therefore
not a banned book at all.

They went directly to the presiding judge
of the French Court in Nam Định to intervene.
As a result, the French Court there
declared my father not guilty.

The French secret police in Thái Bình
suffered an unexpected defeat.
But they never took their eyes
off our family.

$ * * * $

After the August Revolution of 1945,
my father was appointed Director of the Censorship Office
for the North in Hà Nội,
under the Ministry of Information and Communications,
headed by Trần Huy Liệu.

He often joked that perhaps because under the French
the censors had banned _Bước Đường Cùng_
and given me such a hard time, now the superiors entrusted me
with this post--so I could better empathize
with fellow writers and journalists.

$ * * * $

Why my father, then teaching in Thái Bình,
came up to Hà Nội to work right after the August Revolution--very few people knew.
Nor did he consider it something to brag about.

Here is the story:

After the Japanese coup against the French
on March 9, 1945,
my father was still teaching
in Thái Bình.
He took part in the Việt Minh’s
open activities there.
As the movement surged,
the Japanese caught wind of it
and began repression.

A few days earlier, a young man claiming to be
an old student had come to visit, but my father couldn’t recognize him.
An acquaintance warned us he was Japanese secret police,
sniffing around for an angle,
so we should be careful.
My father didn't care--only after he was arrested
did he see the warning was true.

The Japanese arrested him in Thái Bình,
then brought him to Hà Nội,
and jailed him in the basement
of the Shell oil company building
on Gambetta Street (now Trần Hưng Đạo Street).

At that time in our family, some were still imprisoned,
others had gone underground to work in the resistance.
Only my mother remained at home, nearly driven mad
with grief and fear, as threats pressed down
on every side.

After August 19, 1945, the Japanese in Hà Nội
had to hand over some detainees to the Revolutionary side;
my father was among them.
Thereafter he was assigned to the Censorship Office
for the North,
and he stayed on in Hà Nội from then on.

This story was closely bound up
with my elder brother,
Nguyễn Tài Khoái.

The Second World War had broken out.
The French colonial regime
in Đông Dương tightened the screws
on civil liberties—
relaxed only briefly under
the Popular Front in France.

At the end of the school year,
my father was away in Hải Phòng,
serving on an exam board.

One night someone shouted at our gate:
“Mr. Hoan! The _Quan đốc_ is calling!”#footnote[_Quan đốc/Đốc học_: district/provincial chief school inspector under the colonial system.]
(meaning he had urgent business at night).
When the gate opened,
a jumble of French and Vietnamese
secret police—dozens—poured in.
As they pushed through they barked,
“Where’s Bông? Where’s Khoái?”
(my uncle and my brother).

They sat the two down on the spot,
hands cuffed,
then searched the house,
ransacking everything--especially books and papers.
After that they led the two away.
Later we learned they were held
at the French police office in Nam Định.

In this sweep my uncle
Nguyễn Công Bông
was sentenced to five years
and exiled to Sơn La.
My brother Nguyễn Tài Khoái
was arrested the same year,
but for lack of evidence
and because he was still a minor,
he was released
and allowed to continue his studies.

Two years later, my brother was arrested again
right in class, along with several schoolmates.
This time the Thái Bình court
sentenced him to two years.
He appealed in Hà Nội, and the term was reduced
to one year.
After serving his sentence,
he was put under house arrest
with our family in the town of Thái Bình,
required to report monthly to the French police office.

But even while under surveillance,
he slipped away to work
in the underground.
Soon he was arrested a third time
and received a five-year sentence,
imprisoned at Hỏa Lò, Hà Nội#footnote[Hỏa Lò Prison in Hà Nội, used by the French for political prisoners.].

Early in 1945,
amid the ravages of the famine,
a townsman brought word one day
that my brother was being escorted
from Hà Nội back to Thái Bình
to stand trial once more.
At noon, because the jail
had not yet received prisoners,
he waited in the courthouse yard.
When our family arrived,
the escorting guards allowed us
to speak with him.
We learned he had been brought back
to Thái Bình for an additional trial,
connected to another case
that the secret police
had not known about before.

Before the August Revolution of 1945,
our home served as a contact point
and meeting place for cadres
of the Thái Bình Provincial Party Committee,
who were still operating underground.

After March 9, 1945,
my brother was released from jail
in Thái Bình
and joined the revolutionary mobilization
right there in the town.
After March 9, 1945, my father took part
in the Việt Minh’s open activities in Thái Bình,
which is the context
in which the Japanese arrested him.

As for my brother, when word came
that the Japanese were about to arrest him again,
he received an order
to leave Thái Bình secretly for another location.
Later, Lê Quang Đạo told me that at that time
he and my brother were working together in Bắc Giang.

After the August Revolution of 1945,
my brother Khoái served in
Hải Phòng, Nam Định, and Thái Bình,
then returned to Nam Định
near the time of the
Nationwide Resistance.
While he was in Hải Phòng, there was a trip to Hà Nội for a meeting;
that was the last time the two of us saw each other,
before he passed away in mid-1947 in Nam Định.

My parents were heartbroken
greiving for him.

In 1948,
I received a letter from my father
sent from Việt Bắc#footnote[_Việt Bắc_: the northern resistance base area during the First Indochina War.],
informing me that
because of my brother’s death,
my father decided
to join the Indochinese Communist Party.
