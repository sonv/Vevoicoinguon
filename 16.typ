= 16. My First Trips Abroad

My father told me this:

After 1955, the Hội Nhà văn Việt Nam began engaging in international activities.
My father represented our Association at the Asian–African Writers’ Conference held in India.

At that time, Nguyễn Cơ Thạch was serving as the Consul General of Việt Nam in India, and he assisted the delegation of the Hội Nhà văn Việt Nam with much valuable experience in international work.

Our Writers’ Association had no English-speaking member to accompany the delegation.
So our Consulate General in India had to provide an interpreter to help my father communicate with writers from Asia and Africa.

Many foreign writers gave my father books as keepsakes.
My father brought home a scarf from the Burmese Writers’ Association, covered with signatures of many writers attending the Conference; to this day, some of those signatures remain visible.
One African painter gave my father several small color paintings of African figures on cardboard; when he returned home he hung them in his room, and they still exist.

When meeting several Chinese writers, although my father did not speak Chinese, he knew enough classical chữ Nho to express himself, so the two sides could converse through “written dialogue.”

He said:
“When reading my speech at the Conference, I only had to read the first few sentences.
Then the interpreter read the entire English translation that had been prepared in advance.
Near the end, I only needed to read the last few lines myself.”
My father called that the way of working he enjoyed most.

My father also told this story:

In 1960, the Soviet Writers’ Union invited him for a visit.
It was his first time in the Soviet Union, and everything felt new.

At that time, Nicolin had already learned Vietnamese in order to study Vietnamese literature.
He had translated several of my father’s short stories into Russian and published them there.
In that collection was a story titled “Đàn bà là giống yếu.”
The illustrator drew a very large, round woman on the cover.
Anyone who saw it could not help laughing.
My father brought a copy home.
(Later I gave it to a Russian friend working in Hà Nội at the time, so he could read it for amusement when homesick.)

When my father worked with the Soviet Writers’ Union, Nicolin served as interpreter.
They also spoke directly in Vietnamese, so they could talk deeply about literature.

In Việt Nam back then, we were not familiar with certain Soviet practices.
My father was invited to speak on Radio Moscow.
Afterward, they immediately paid him an honorarium as if for publication.
And for the stories that Nicolin had translated and published, when my father arrived in the Soviet Union they handed him a substantial payment in roubles.
Buying gifts for the family used only a little of it; the remaining roubles he could not bring home.

So my father invited his Soviet writer friends—whom he met during that visit—out to the Bắc Kinh Hotel in Moscow for a banquet.
He simply handed over all the remaining roubles to the restaurant so that the entire group could “eat through” the amount.
After the meal, one Russian friend said he had never in his life spent that much money on a single banquet.

Then one day, an officer from the Vietnamese Embassy in the Soviet Union came.
He said that Hồ Chủ tịch had instructed him to bring the Embassy car to pick my father up and take him immediately to where Hồ Chủ tịch was staying.

Hồ Chủ tịch was attending a Communist Party conference there.
My father could not imagine what could be so urgent that Bác would summon him.

He asked, but even the Embassy officer did not know the reason.

My father worried—had he said something inappropriate on the radio?
But once Bác had called, he had to go.

He arrived, met Bác, and was invited to sit.

He asked, “Why did you send for me?”

Bác replied: “I read the newspapers every day.
I saw in the ‘Visitors’ column that you had arrived in Moscow.
I happened to be free today, so I asked them to bring you over to visit.”

Hearing that, my father felt all the cold in his body leave him.
Bác, despite so much work, never missed reading the daily newspaper, and noticed even a tiny announcement.

My father realized that meeting one’s countrymen abroad is always a joy for anyone.

At the same time, he found himself quietly amused.
To Bác, meeting a writer was something ordinary, done with simple warmth.
Yet just moments before, he himself had been so frightened—almost out of his wits.
