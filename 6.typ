= Creating Newspaper in The War Zone 

When the first course of the _Anti-Japanese Military Academy_#footnote[
The Anti-Japanese Military Academy held the graduation ceremony for its first course on July 13, 1945.
] came to an end,  
Văn (Võ Nguyên Giáp) appointed me to take Lê Hiến Mai's place at the Liberated Zone’s printing house
since he was assigned to lead a troop back to Sơn Tây.  

At that time,  
the newspaper _Nước Nam Mới_ (_New Vietnam_),  
published by the Liberated Zone,  
had only put out a few issues.  

According to Văn,  
the printing house was a secret location;  
once assigned there,  
one was not allowed to go anywhere else.  
Indeed,  
the printing house was deep in the forest;  
in Tân Trào,  
only one person knew its location,  
who led me there and then went back.  

Hiến Mai introduced me to the three comrades  
who had already been working there,  
and explained to me the tasks of the newspaper  
as well as the printing work itself.  

There was no printing machine as I had imagined;  
only two white stones, called _lithos_.  
The newspaper was printed on blue paper,  
each issue about one quarter the size of a modern daily sheet,  
and it had four pages in total.  

The larger stone was big enough to print two pages at a time,  
while the smaller one could print only one page.  
Therefore,  
we had to write and print page 1 first;  
while that was being done,  
we wrote pages 2 and 3;  
at the same time,  
we had to smooth out page 1 again  
so that it could be used to write and print page 4.  

Anyone who has worked with lithography knows  
that the stone must be polished flat, without any bumps or pits,  
and that the letters must be written in reverse,  
in black ink directly on the stone.  
Then one rubs lemon juice over it to make the letters stand out,  
rolls ink evenly across the surface,  
and finally uses a roller to press the paper onto the stone,  
so the ink adheres to the page.  
If the roller is not applied evenly,  
the print comes out faint or missing letters.  

At the printing house of _Nước Nam Mới_,  
the roller was nothing more than a short bamboo tube,  
half the width of a newspaper page,  
wrapped in a piece of bicycle inner tube,  
with a chopstick through its core  
so that both hands could hold and roll it from the ends.  

I counted once--it took about a hundred rolls of that bamboo roller  
to finish printing a single page.  
From that alone,  
one can imagine how many times the roller had to be turned  
to complete all four pages of the newspaper,  
and how much effort it required  
each time the number of printed copies increased.  

Văn told me  
that the movement was growing rapidly.  
In the past,  
the newspaper had come out only once in a while,  
each issue with just a few dozen copies.  
Now, he said,  
we had to shorten the time between issues,  
and each printing should reach several hundred copies.  

There were only four of us.  
One person specialized in writing the reversed letters;  
the remaining three worked on polishing the stones and printing.  
We worked together day and night.  
The hardest part was printing at night.  
There were no oil lamps.  
We lit the place using rolls of banana leaves  
soaked in resin from the trám tree.  

Those “candles” often exploded.  
When they burst and hit our hands or legs,  
they burned painfully.  
But worse still  
was when they hit the stone.  
If the sparks landed on a blank spot,  
it was not too bad—we could scrape it lightly and keep printing.  
But if they struck a line of text,  
even in just a few spots,  
sometimes we had to polish the entire stone smooth again  
and rewrite everything from the beginning.  

Printing a newspaper back then  
was nothing like printing today.  
At a reunion of old Liberation Army comrades  
held in Thái Nguyên in 1992,  
as we reminisced about those days,  
Văn mentioned the newspaper _Nước Nam Mới_.  
According to him,  
he was the editor-in-chief at that time,  
and I was in charge of editing and printing.  
Back then,  
I never thought of myself  
as the editor of _Nước Nam Mới_.  
Still,  
in that role,  
I have a few unforgettable stories to tell.  

Once, after finishing the printing of an issue,  
I brought it to Tân Trào to give to Văn for distribution.  
He handed me a drawing,  
but it bore the name of another newspaper —  
_Việt Nam Độc Lập_,  
clearly marked as the paper of the Cao Bằng base.  
This issue was made up only of drawings,  
titled “Rescuing an American Pilot,”  
with about eight or ten illustrations.  

They depicted an American airplane shot down by the Japanese,  
the pilot parachuting to safety,  
landing by chance in a Việt Minh base area,  
being rescued and cared for by the Việt Minh,  
and finally guided across the border  
to return to the Allied forces.  

I asked Văn,  
we were making _Nước Nam Mới_;  
why were we now printing _Việt Nam Độc Lập_ from Cao Bằng?  
Văn only said that it was urgent;  
we needed just a few dozen copies,  
and they had to be delivered right away.  

I returned to the printing place,  
and we agreed to print this issue as quickly as possible.  
None of us could draw,  
and I myself had no artistic skill,  
so we had to copy from the original sketches,  
drawing and writing the reversed letters by hand.  
Within just a few days, it was done.  
I immediately brought the printed copies to Tân Trào  
and handed them to Văn.  
He praised me  
for finishing the printing in time  
to send the papers abroad.  

At that time,  
we had already built a small airfield,  
and it so happened that an Allied plane was landing.  
This event showed that the Việt Minh had a strong base and forces,  
and that we were cooperating with the Allies.  

We were all deeply encouraged  
by the success of this work.  

But a few days later,  
I received a few verses —  
some praising, some teasing.  
They said, in essence:  
“The Việt Minh base must have been so harsh  
that the American pilot, tall when he parachuted down,  
had become short by the time he reached the border.”  

I compared the printed copy with the original drawing,  
and indeed,  
because I hadn’t paid close attention while sketching,  
the American pilot in the later panels  
appeared shorter than the Việt Minh guide.  

As I mentioned earlier,  
we had to print the pages one by one —  
first page 1,  
then pages 2 and 3 together,  
and finally page 4.  
That created many difficulties  
in arranging and printing the articles  
on the two lithographic stones of different sizes.  
When an article was too long to fit on the front page  
and had to continue on the next,  
it was always a headache for me.  

Once,  
even the following page didn’t have enough room  
(since we didn’t have typefaces of varying sizes like today),  
so I had no choice
but to cut out a few sentences  
to make everything fit.  

Unexpectedly,  
one day I received an article submitted for publication.  
It told the story of a propaganda officer  
who spoke with great passion and eloquence,  
but when someone later asked the villagers what he had said,  
they replied that they had no idea what his talk was about.  

The article ended with a few lines  
that I still remember to this day:  
“Hundred bows, thousand bows to our comrades in propaganda —  
when you speak, please make it so the people can understand.  
And as for our comrades in journalism —  
please stop cutting off the beginnings and endings of articles,  
leaving readers unable to grasp the full meaning.”  

At that time,  
to be honest, I wasn’t very pleased with that piece,  
but Văn had instructed that it must be printed,  
so I went ahead and published it in full.  

Later, when I met Văn,  
I complained to him about it.  
He only laughed and said,  
“If they’re right, we should accept it and learn from it.”  
Then he quietly revealed to me  
that the drawing for “Rescuing an American Pilot,”  
as well as the article criticizing propaganda and journalism,  
were both written by “Ông Ké” — that is, Uncle Hồ himself.  

I once mentioned how I had secretly come to know  
who “Ông Ké” really was.  
So when I heard that,  
though I still felt a bit resentful,  
I could find nothing more to say.  
After all,  
it was something from when I was nineteen.  

Years later,  
when I read Uncle Hồ’s book _Sửa đổi lề lối làm việc (Rectifying the Working Style)_
I finally understood its full meaning.  

Once, when I visited the Revolutionary Museum  
and saw that they still kept a few issues of _Nước Nam Mới_,  
I suddenly felt deeply moved,  
remembering Uncle Hồ’s words of advice  
sent to me long ago,  
when I was making the newspaper  
in the resistance base of Tân Trào.
