= 22. Returning to the roots

In April 1995, I traveled from Hà Nội to the South to attend several gatherings of comrades who had fought together during the resistance against the Americans.

On 2 April, there was a meeting of cadres and fighters from the Ban An ninh Trung ương Cục miền Nam.
On 9 April in Củ Chi, there was a gathering of cadres and fighters from Ban An ninh T4 (Khu Sài Gòn–Gia Định) who had lived and fought together in Củ Chi.
On 16 April at Dinh Thống Nhất, there was a meeting of former cadres from the various Bans and sectors of the Trung ương Cục miền Nam, along with several delegates from the old B2 zones.
On 22 April at the Công an of Hồ Chí Minh City, there was a gathering of cadres and fighters from Ban An ninh T4 during the anti-American period.

The day 30 April 1975 entered history as a great victory of our entire nation.
The South “went first and returned last”; the South belonged to the whole country, and the whole country had once been present in the South.
Go to any cemetery for martyrs in the South: beside the graves with names, there are always many graves with blank headstones.
Everyone understands that these are the graves of fighters from the main-force units, whose hometowns were somewhere in the North.
Now that “Bắc Nam sum họp, Xuân nào vui hơn” (in Bác Hồ’s words), we forever remember the martyrs.

For me personally, that day was also the day our troops freed me from the Mỹ–ngụy prison; so I am deeply grateful to the Party, to the Army, and to our people (including my own comrades) whose victorious struggle allowed me to escape death and regain my freedom.

The enemy not only violated the Paris Agreement and refused to release me.
Later, when personnel from the American–Saigon intelligence services surrendered for re-education, some reported that on 26 April 1975 their American and Saigon commanders had issued an order to kill me.
But as our forces were already closing in on Sài Gòn, the lower-level agents, fearing additional crimes, did not dare carry it out.
(This matched the account in the memoir of Frank Snepp, a CIA officer, who wrote that their plan was to put me on a helicopter and drop me into the sea.)

My family regards 30 April 1975 as the day I was reborn, when the South was completely liberated and our country was reunified.

Amid the great victory and happiness shared by the whole nation and by my family in particular, I always remember the martyrs — especially the comrades who fell on the battlefield before victory — as well as the people and safe houses who sheltered and helped me and my comrades during the hard years.
So, between the reunion gatherings mentioned above, I took the opportunity to visit old bases, places where comrades had died, and the families they left behind.

Time did not allow me to visit every place and every family.
And wherever I went, people wanted me to stay longer, but I had to apologize.

Let me mention a few of the places I visited.

I visited chị Năm Tấn.
Her husband, anh Năm, was Deputy Chief of Ban An ninh T4, and was killed after the Mậu Thân offensive in Phân khu I (his grave was only found in recent years, as bombs had erased all traces).
Anh Năm and I had spent much time living together in Củ Chi and had worked very well with each other, although his hometown was right in Hóc Môn while mine was all the way in the North (Hưng Yên).

I also visited several families of fallen comrades from the former An ninh T4, and the places where some cadres of Ban An ninh T4 had fallen after I myself had been captured.

I visited many families who had helped us in earlier years, in many parts of the South.

I also visited, and through the Công an of the various provinces where An ninh T4 had once been based, conveyed my gratitude to the Party organizations and mass organizations in those localities for their wholehearted support.

Each visit had its own meaning.

In March 1964, I had entered the South by unnumbered ship.
The first place I reached in the South was Rạch Gốc, in today’s Năm Căn district of Minh Hải Province.
Back then, đồng chí Hai Dĩa (real name Bông Văn Dĩa) organized the harbour to receive the unnumbered ships and welcomed us.
He was later awarded the title Hero of the People’s Armed Forces.

In 1990, I had already returned here once.
By then, anh Hai Dĩa had passed away; only chị Hai remained.
This year, I returned to Rạch Gốc and visited their family again.
She was eighty-five years old; the family lived modestly, even though anh Hai was a Hero, and they had a son who was also a martyr.
When I returned to Hà Nội, I reported this situation to the Prime Minister for consideration.

Meeting old people in familiar places, my heart was deeply moved — especially when I compared the conditions of the families of those who had made great contributions with the wastefulness of public funds by corrupt officials.

During Christmas 1965, with the approval of the T4 Party Committee, I entered Sài Gòn for the first time to conduct field research.
That trip allowed me to draw conclusions that helped Northern cadres newly arriving in the South strengthen their resolve to operate in Sài Gòn.
The taxi driver who took me around was anh Tư, the elder brother of Tám Trọng (an officer of An ninh T4).
I will never forget how, on the night I stayed at his house, anh Tư pretended to be repairing his vehicle and kept a lamp burning at the door all night, ready in case of a house search or neighborhood sweep, to keep me safe.
This year he was retired.
He was delighted to see me again and to recall old memories.

During the first Mậu Thân offensive in 1968, I had stayed at the home of anh chị Ba; their house was burned by the enemy in the second offensive.
Their eldest son, Nhơn, had gone out to the liberated zone to join the Giải phóng.
After I was freed from prison, I came here to seek contact with the Organization.
That night it rained heavily, and the house leaked everywhere.
The family gave me the hammock — the only dry spot.
Anh Ba and one of his sons, who had picked up an AR15 dropped by soldiers on the street, took turns keeping watch, thinking that the area might still be unsafe.
How could I sleep?
So everyone gathered in the driest corner of the house, talking into the night.

In 1990, when houses were cleared for the Đầm Sen road project, anh chị Ba had to move elsewhere, without leaving me their new address.
This time, I had to ask many comrades before I could find and meet them again.
The whole family was overjoyed to see me.

Công an Thành phố Hồ Chí Minh — which traces its origin to An ninh T4 — has been awarded the title Hero of the People’s Armed Forces by the Hội đồng Nhà Nước.

Our Công an’s achievements come from our own efforts, but in every situation we also had immense help from the people.
That is why we must always remember the role of the people; and why we must never forget the grassroots bases among the people, those who helped us — especially in the difficult years of the revolution before victory on 30 April 1975.
I hope that both earlier and later generations in the Công an of Hồ Chí Minh City will work to preserve and promote the fine traditions and the honorable title of the unit.

I regret that I did not have enough time to visit everyone I wished to.

Especially because, due to an oversight on 1 May 1975, to this day I still do not know the names or addresses of the two young women (who must now be nearly forty, perhaps already mothers) who, knowing only that I had just been freed from prison, helped me lovingly to reach Bình Thới — and thereby helped me find the home of anh chị Ba mentioned above.
If I knew their names, I would certainly have visited them to express my thanks.

These are all my thoughts and faith in the heroic people of our Motherland.
