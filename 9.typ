= 9. The decisive blow: the discovery of the Ôn Như Hầu affair

Over fifty years of struggle and growth,
the lực lượng Công an nhân dân Việt Nam fulfilled its responsibilities.
Working in many areas, both inside and outside the country,
the achievements and victories of our entire force across the nation
have shown that the Công an nhân dân xứng đáng là
“thanh bảo kiếm bảo vệ mình, tiêu diệt địch.”

However, in the fifty-year history of the Công an nhân dân Việt Nam,
there are few instances in which a single case — just one —
allowed the Công an to contribute directly and decisively
to safeguarding the revolutionary government,
the Party, and national independence;
and to bringing down the prestige of a political party
with a long history that had let political opportunists seize control.
That case was the discovery at 132 Duvigneau(1)
and 7 Ôn Như Hầu(2),
with the opening action taking place
at 132 Duvigneau, Hà Nội, on 12 July 1946.

At that time, I was responsible only for small tasks
in the Sở Công an Bắc Bộ.
But because of special circumstances,
I witnessed certain important details
amid a rush of fast-moving events.
By recounting these details,
I hope to contribute a little
to reconstructing this historical event of our sector.

In September 1945, returning from Tân Trào to Hà Nội with Lê Giản,
I was also assigned to the Sở Liêm phóng Bắc Bộ.
At first I followed “confidential” work for the leadership.
When the “neutralization” of the Công an took place in 1946,
I moved to the Phòng Chính trị (now An ninh chính trị)
to do research work,
while still keeping certain confidential tasks
and serving as the secretary of the Party cell.

At that time, comrades with families lived at home,
but several of us lived together
in a house at the corner of today’s Trần Hưng Đạo
and Trần Bình Trọng streets.
Living there, apart from Lê Giản
(Tổng Giám đốc Nha Công an),
and Hoàng Mỹ (Phó Giám đốc Sở),
were Bùi Đức Minh (Trưởng phòng Chính trị),
Phạm Gia Nội, Bùi Văn Thái (Phòng Quản trị),
and myself.
In the large upstairs room,
there was one big bed,
a long table for meetings,
and a wooden floor where, if space ran out,
we spread mats to sleep.

As we know, after the Chinese Nationalist forces
withdrew from northern Việt Nam following 6 March 1946,
the French brought some of their troops into Hà Nội
and several northern provinces
(even as they were already waging war in the South).

The Việt Nam Quốc dân đảng,
previously backed by the Chinese Nationalists,
had set up public headquarters in Hà Nội,
issued newspapers openly attacking the revolutionary government,
and even took over the Ngũ Xã area,
turning it into an anti-revolutionary base in the capital.
Taking advantage of the policy of forming a Liên hiệp Government,
and with seventy Quốc hội deputies belonging to them,
even after the Chinese withdrew,
they continued all their activities and opposition as before.

Our Công an still regarded the reactionary Quốc dân đảng
as a dangerous adversary.
Thus, in addition to facing the French,
it was natural for us to conduct regular surveillance
and keep track of their activities.

As I mentioned earlier, though I did not work in trinh sát,
I worked with comrades in the research section,
so we had access to reports on the enemy situation.

At that time, there was also a particular Party directive:
to preserve secrecy, leaders of agencies,
though Party members,
did not attend Party cell meetings,
but instead took part in Đảng đoàn meetings.
The Party cell secretary, however,
attended both.
Initially Hoàng Mỹ was the secretary;
with this directive, I became the Party cell secretary
and was also elected Secretary of the Đoàn Công an cứu quốc.
Because of this role, and because we lived together,
I learned many important matters within the sector.

I will not go into the strategies or operational details
of the trinh sát forces of Nha Công an
or Công an Bắc Bộ at that time.
I only recall that alongside the Political Trinh sát force
led by Lê Hữu Qua,
Nguyễn Tạo at Nha Công an
also had his own independent trinh sát group;
and Lê Giản had a team of his own
led by Mạnh
(a Party member in the cell I headed —
Mạnh later died on the night of 19 December 1946).

Back then, although Nha Công an had been established,
it occupied only a single house
facing today’s Trần Bình Trọng.
Other houses on that street
were occupied by Phan Mạnh Hân and Vũ Đình Khoa;
later Nguyễn Tạo also lived in one.
It was easy to see one another.

On the morning of 12 July 1946,
just at dawn,
Nguyễn Tạo came to our corner house.
He woke us and showed us a flyer
whose ink was still wet.
It was issued by the Quốc dân đảng,
calling for the overthrow of the revolutionary government.

Lê Hữu Qua lived with his family on Lò Đúc Street,
so he was not there that morning.
Only Lê Giản, Hoàng Mỹ, Bùi Đức Minh,
Phạm Gia Nội, and I were present.
At the time, Hoàng Hữu Nam,
Thứ trưởng Bộ Nội vụ,
often came to meet the Công an leadership at our house.

If I remember correctly,
after seeing the above evidence,
Lê Giản contacted Hoàng Hữu Nam.
A little later, Hoàng Hữu Nam arrived.
He examined the document
and left with Lê Giản.

Later I heard that
when cụ Huỳnh Thúc Kháng
saw the evidence with his own eyes,
he exclaimed, “Bọn này đểu!”
As Quyền Chủ tịch Nước
(while Bác Hồ was in France)
and Bộ trưởng Bộ Nội vụ,
cụ Huỳnh agreed to suppress them.

What happened afterward is well known,
for the case was tried publicly.

I only want to emphasize this:
without concrete evidence like this,
it would have been impossible
to persuade cụ Huỳnh
to make such a swift decision.

The action began with the search and arrest
at 132 Duvigneau,
where the flyers were being printed.
Throughout the day,
other headquarters in Hà Nội were searched.
Among them, the main target
was 80 Quán Thánh.
7 Ôn Như Hầu was also searched,
but in the beginning
we did not yet know
the horrifying crimes committed there.

I recall several details:

– The arrest of Phan Kích Nam at 7 Ôn Như Hầu.
At first, relying on his status as a Quốc hội deputy,
he drew his sword to threaten us.
Our Công an, though not fully aware of who he was,
arrested him anyway.
We had to treat him properly throughout the day.
By afternoon, we obtained an official document
from the Ủy ban Thường vụ Quốc hội.
When it was read to him,
Phan Kích Nam collapsed, turned pale,
and bowed his head.
At dusk he was taken to the detention area
inside the grounds of the Sở Công an.

– The documents seized at 80 Quán Thánh
were the most numerous.
I sorted and read them immediately.
Among them I found a record
of a meeting between the Việt Nam Quốc dân đảng
and the Đại Việt Quốc dân đảng.
In essence:
the two sides agreed to set aside internal differences;
to drop “Việt Nam” and “Đại Việt” in their public name,
using only “Quốc dân đảng”
both to conceal matters from Việt Minh
and to project greater strength to the public;
organizational distinctions would remain internal.

– The discovery of the murders at 7 Ôn Như Hầu
began because that house connected
to a house on phố Ha-Le(3),
where we had information
and had paid attention.
One man held there for ransom
was still alive,
and from him we learned
that the reactionaries had thrown victims
into hồ Ha-Le (Thiền Quang today);
and later we discovered
others buried under a banana tree
in the yard of 7 Ôn Như Hầu.
This discovery, once made public,
filled the population with disgust.
With the public trial,
the reactionary Quốc dân đảng
was completely unmasked.
Afterward, the policy was set
to dismantle their organization nationwide.

– Their conspiracy to collaborate with the French
in overthrowing the revolutionary government,
combined with robbery and murder,
gave the revolutionary State
full grounds to place the Quốc dân đảng
outside the law.
This was a decisive political blow.

Some have claimed
that Nguyễn Tường Tam, Đỗ Đình Đạo, and others
were arrested at this time.
I recall that this was not the case.

If it had been,
how could the following events have occurred?

Nguyễn Tường Tam, then Bộ trưởng Bộ Ngoại giao,
absconded with a large sum of public money.
Later, when I worked in the South during the anti-American period,
Nguyễn Tường Tam returned to Sài Gòn for a time.
The Sài Gòn press praised him loudly.
Then, for some reason, he took his own life,
and the press again made much of it.

Vũ Hồng Khanh also lived in Sài Gòn
and attempted to revive the Việt Nam Quốc dân đảng,
but without success.
After 30 April 1975 he turned himself in,
attended re-education,
and wrote extensive statements.

During the resistance against the French,
Đỗ Đình Đạo lived in inner Hà Nội.

Nghiêm Kế Tổ, then Bộ trưởng Kinh tế
in the Liên hiệp Government,
went to France with a negotiating delegation
but was exposed for illicit dealings.
When he returned to Hà Nội,
after 12 July 1946,
I asked Trần Kim Xuyến
(from Bộ Thông tin — later killed in action)
to photograph him
under the pretext of a commemorative picture,
so that Công an would have his image.

The case at 132 Duvigneau,
which initiated the complete dismantling
of the reactionary Quốc dân đảng
— both its forces and its political influence —
has gone into history
as a major victory of the Công an nhân dân Việt Nam.

I believe that
within just one year of its founding,
the Công an Việt Nam
devised its own methods
(drawing on the people,
and using the enemy’s own agents against them),
and from a single concrete case
amplified the results
into a political blow
that struck the entire reactionary organization,
while simultaneously crushing
a French plot
to stage a coup in the capital
even as they were invading the South.
It was a brilliant achievement:
one strike against two enemies.

It is a lesson
in revolutionary spirit,
self-reliance,
and creativity.
