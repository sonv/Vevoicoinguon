= 13. Journeys and Encounters

In mid-1950, the French army pushed outward and occupied Vân Đình and Phủ Lý, narrowing and threatening the liberated zone of Liên khu Ba on the right bank of the Red River.
At the same time, they conducted heavy sweeps in the outskirts of Hà Nội, which were deep within the temporarily occupied zone; as a result, the resistance movement inside Hà Nội also showed signs of slowing down.

The Bí thư of the Đặc khu ủy Hà Nội was Trần Quốc Hoàn, who at that time used the alias Nguyễn Quang Thành.
While resistance activities in Hà Nội still followed the old methods, Hoàn, a veteran revolutionary who had lived through many periods of struggle, began thinking about how to sustain and further develop the resistance movement in Hà Nội.

At that time, the Điệp báo office of the Nha Công an and the Hà Nội Tình báo unit had just been merged into Công an Hà Nội.
With Nguyễn Phủ Doãn as Director of Công an, Hoàn discussed with me that I should temporarily hand over my responsibilities at the base in order to carry out a new mission assigned by the Cấp ủy.

I needed to enter the inner city so that, through contact with both organized and unorganized supporters, and through my own direct observations, I could report back to the base.
These reports, together with reports from the two inner-city Quận ủy, would help the Đặc khu ủy determine whether the movement could continue under the old pattern or whether our methods needed to change.

In August 1950, Trần Hoàng Bá from the Công an liaison network arranged a secret trip for me.
We crossed the Đáy River above Vân Đình at dusk.
We walked through the Miêng fields in the rain—half the village Buddhist, half Catholic—then crossed road 22 above the Vác crossroads, where the French had a post.
We waded through the flooded chiêm rice fields into the village of Bồ Nâu in Thanh Oai district, which was enemy-controlled but where we still had a secret base.

As soon as we arrived, we learned that the previous night the enemy had swept through the village and destroyed the secret shelter at our base house.
The situation was very tangled.
We needed to stay the night and all the next day, and only move onward at night toward the outskirts of Hà Nội, then enter the inner city.
But it was impossible to continue that same night.
The enemy knew the pattern of our night-time liaison routes into the outskirts, so they often ambushed the area between the Ngọc Hồi culvert and Văn Điển.

Seeing that the situation was unsafe, Bá insisted that I return to the liberated zone and wait for another trip.
We had to leave that very night.

It was still raining.
Our clothes were soaked and we shivered with cold.
On the way back, we again had to wade through the chiêm fields, water up to our chests, in some places up to our necks.
Each time we climbed over a field ridge, we had to scrape off the leeches clinging all over our bodies.

Near road 22, we lost our way.
Fortunately, the Vác post suddenly swept a searchlight across the fields, giving us a reference to regain our direction.

By the time we reached the Miêng fields, it was already well past midnight.
If we did not move quickly and cross the Đáy River before dawn, it would be dangerous.

It continued to rain.
We were exhausted and sleepy.
The field ridges were slippery as grease.
Because our eyes could no longer distinguish the color of earth from the color of waterlogged fields, we frequently slipped and plunged into the mud.

At last, we reached the base in a weak-zone village along the Đáy River in Mỹ Đức district.

$ * * * $


Near Tết that year, I resumed the plan to enter the inner city.
This time, Bùi Đức Việt escorted me.

Having learned from the previous attempt, I discussed with Việt how we might travel in a manner different from the usual liaison routes, which the enemy already knew and often ambushed.

In the morning, from Hữu Văn village—still a liberated area of Chương Mỹ district—we crossed the river into Tốt Động village, also in Chương Mỹ but now a weak zone.

Ahead of us, a middle-aged female giao liên, living legally under enemy administration, walked some distance in front to scout for enemy presence.
She carried a shoulder pole loaded with bundles, including a set of Western clothes I would later wear.

The two of us followed behind, dressed in brown peasant clothes, wearing conical hats, covered with straw rain capes, pistols and grenades tucked behind our backs.

Near noon, we reached the stone road of Quảng Bị.
We sat in a cornfield to wait while the giao liên checked the situation.
The northerly wind was bitterly cold.
When she signaled that it was safe, we crossed the road and entered the village.
From there we waded across the Đáy River into Thanh Oai district.
It was the dry season, and the water only reached our calves.

On the far side of the river was the Kim Bài area.
We climbed onto the dyke and could clearly see road 22—when vehicles passed and when none did.
Walking straight through the fields, we crossed road 22 in broad daylight.
After that the giao liên remained behind.
Only the two of us continued.

That night we waded across the Cầu Chiếc River, the water icy cold.
We arrived at a base to rest.
The next day, before full dark, we were already near the Văn Điển area.
Because we had covered so much distance earlier, we avoided passing through at the late hours when the enemy usually set ambushes for liaison groups.
We could see all movement on the road clearly.
And at a time when the enemy least expected it, just below Văn Điển, we crossed national road 1—but at a point different from the usual liaison path.

Our direction was toward Yên Mỹ village, but we did not enter the village.
Instead we walked along the foot of the dyke straight toward Nam Dư Thượng.

Near Nam Dư, we suddenly heard drums and gongs clanging loudly.
Knowing there was trouble in the village, we waited at the foot of the dyke.
Near midnight, when all was quiet, we waded through fields, slipped through a bamboo hedge, and entered the house of our base contact.
We learned that soldiers had entered the village earlier.
We ate the last cold rice balls we had brought, then slept right there in the kitchen atop a pile of dry corn stalks—used by the family as firewood—without feeling any aches at all.

At dawn the next day, the family went to the market to buy food, pretending to prepare for a death anniversary, in order to gather information.

By early afternoon, there were no soldiers.
The giao liên from that village walked ahead along the field paths, carrying her goods.
I had already changed into Western clothes.
Barefoot, I followed behind.
When we reached Tương Mai village, I stopped by a pond to wash my feet and put on shoes.
Then we went to the main road and hired a rickshaw to enter the city.

$ * * * $

The place I needed to reach was the maternity clinic of Dr. Nguyễn Bách.
There, I would meet his secretary and hand him a handwritten note.
That note was the signal that would help me establish contact with Kim Tấn, a Công an officer in the inner city.

It was still raining.
There were no police on the streets.
The rickshaw had its canvas hood drawn tightly.

The maternity clinic was right at the Hàng Kèn slope intersection.
When I arrived, I met the secretary of Dr. Bách at once.
(I will call him Ba in this chapter.)
He sat at a table near the entrance and invited me to sit in the chairs reserved for visitors.

Not long after, Dr. Bách asked him to accompany him somewhere.

I waited, reading almost the entire Catholic Bible placed on the guest table.
Dusk was approaching, and Ba still had not returned.
The midwives told me that Ba lived in the small attic room in the clinic, so it was common for him to come back late.
At dinner time the midwives directed me to a stall across the street selling cơm tám and giò chả, where I had my meal.
Then I came back to sit and wait.
It was already late when Ba finally returned.
He told me that Kim Tấn came there only once a week.
He had just come the previous day.
So I would have to wait until the next week.

That night Ba lay under his blanket reading secret documents by using a light bulb placed inside a punched-out condensed-milk can, both to shield the light and to warm himself.

The next day Ba told me to stay in his room.
For meals I had to go out to the food stall like before.
But by late afternoon, whether they sensed something or simply felt sympathetic, the midwives invited me to eat dinner with them so I would not have to go out.

$ * * * $

If I had to wait like this for a whole week, it would be troublesome.
That evening, I told Ba I wanted to go out into the streets for a while.
Inside, I intended to seek contact on my own.
I remembered the address of Ngọc “đen” at 110 Bovet Street (now Yết Kiêu).

Once out of sight of the maternity clinic, I hired a xích lô to Bovet Street.
I walked straight into number 110.
The family was having dinner—some sitting, some standing.
Seeing a stranger enter suddenly, they were startled.

But I had already caught sight of Kim Tấn.
He was about to slip into the back room.
I softly called out.
He turned and saw me.
Recognizing me, he reassured the family.

After a short while, Kim Tấn took me to number 11 on today’s Phan Bội Châu Street.
On the rooftop was a small attic room.
The owner of the house was a base contact of Ngọc “đen,” and a relative of lawyer Vũ Văn Hiền, one of Hà Nội’s prominent intellectuals whom the inner-city press called a “trùm chăn.”
The house was privately owned, but the small ground-floor rooms were rented out.
This rooftop attic was where Ngọc “đen,” Kim Tấn, and Phan Khắc Trình often met.

When we arrived, Ngọc “đen” was already there.
He told us that Trình was expected later.

No one had imagined I would enter the inner city.
They were overjoyed to see me.

That night, the four of us squeezed onto a small wooden bed.
They made me recount everything about “outside.”
We talked until morning.

At dawn, they left one by one.
Kim Tấn would inform Ba at Dr. Bách’s clinic that he had already met me, so Ba would not worry.
Ngọc “đen” told the host family—who were our base contacts—to let me eat with them that day.

$ * * * $

I stayed there one day.
The next evening, Ngọc “đen” took me to Wiélé Street—now Tô Hiến Thành—to the home of the Huấn Linh family, patriotic intellectuals.
I played the role of a private tutor for their children.
(The location is now the headquarters of Công an quận Hai Bà.)

The first night, sleeping on a mattress with a cotton blanket, I lay awake thinking of the comrades in the liberated zone and could not sleep.

$ * * * $

At that time, several inner-city Công an personnel from Hà Nội had been arrested and turned by the enemy—men like Tốn, Hùng đen, and Hùng khoèo.
They were extremely dangerous; they had identified and caused the arrest of several Hà Nội Công an officers.
They knew my face very well, so the comrades decided that I should only go out onto the streets at night.

I arranged immediately to meet Trần Sâm and Tiến Đức to convey Hoàn’s ideas.
At that time, each of them was Bí thư of one inner-city Quận ủy.

$ * * * $

A few days later, my meeting with Trần Sâm was arranged at the home of Lê Bằng, son-in-law of Professor Mai Phương, on Nguyễn Trãi Street (now Nguyễn Văn Tố).
Bằng gave us his bed, and we talked through the night.

The next time, Sâm arranged to meet me at Bovet Street (now Yết Kiêu).
This was the house of Nguyễn Văn Chế, brother-in-law of Trần Duy Hưng, the first Chairman of the Hà Nội Administrative Committee.
Chế had been our Chánh Văn phòng of the Nha Công an in 1946 but was unfortunately trapped inside the city when the resistance broke out.
Chế knew me.
Seeing me working secretly inside the city made him both anxious for my safety and glad to see an old comrade again.

I had to arrive the night before, sleep there, meet Sâm the next day, then wait until dark to return to my own shelter.

(Later, Chế moved to the corner of today’s Điện Biên Phủ and Tống Duy Tân streets, and again let us use his home as a meeting point.
After 1954, Chế was admitted to the Party.)

$ * * * $

Tiến Đức wanted me to attend a full Quận ủy meeting.
So during Tết, he arranged for me to go to a house in Hàng Đũa alley (now Ngô Sĩ Liên).
This house belonged to Quốc Minh, a Quận ủy member.
I arrived the night before and stayed there so I could attend the meeting the next day.
Quốc Minh was already waiting for me, and we both stayed the night.

That evening, just as we were about to sleep, we suddenly heard loud Western voices at the gate.
The homeowner quickly helped Quốc Minh and me climb up a ladder to the attic, which had been prepared as a hiding place.

After a while, things became quiet, and the homeowner called us down.
It turned out the French and Vietnamese police were raiding a gambling den in the house next door.
They had no suspicion about this house.

Quốc Minh was frightened.
He had arranged for me to come to his base house.
If I had been caught there, he did not know how he would ever explain it to Hoàn.


$ * * * $
However, if I wanted to make contact and understand the feelings and aspirations of base cadres and ordinary people outside the organization, always slipping around “by night” like this would never meet the Cấp ủy’s requirements.
So I told the comrades that they should set meetings during the day as well, and that I would still find a way to go.

After that, I was able to meet many cadres, Party members, and mass-base contacts, and at those places I sometimes talked with people outside the organization without their having any idea who I was.

The reports I sent back to Hoàn, together with those from the two Quận ủy, helped the Cấp ủy gain a much clearer view of the inner-city situation than before.

By 1952, the Đặc khu ủy decided to shift the mode of activity in inner Hà Nội, combining secret illegal work with legal and semi-legal work.
This new line remained in force up to the Điện Biên campaign and the Geneva Conference on Indochina, by which time the movement had gathered new momentum.

$ * * * $
One evening, near dusk, I was pushing my bicycle along Wiélé Street toward Phố Huế when two policemen blew their whistles and stopped me.
I got off the bicycle, switched on the generator, lifted the front wheel, and spun it so the light came on.
Pretending to be checked for riding without lights, I said, “It isn’t dark yet, so I haven’t turned on the light.”

One of the policemen told me to show my identity card.
He looked at my face and compared it to the photo.
Then, with one finger, he flicked the photo pasted on the card.
The picture stayed firmly in place.
He handed the card back and told me I could go.

Later, I heard that the enemy had discovered a number of forged identity cards where the photos were stuck on with rice paste.
If you flicked the photo with a finger, it would peel right off.
That policeman had followed his superiors’ instructions exactly, looking for fake papers.

But our “identity cards” were made with entirely genuine materials taken from the enemy: the card stock and the lead printing plates were originals from them.
Our Công an base contact was a worker at the printing house that made identity cards for the Sở mật thám.
After each print run for the enemy, those materials were secretly passed to us.
We simply printed and forged the signatures.
As for the photos, we used the same kind of glue the enemy did, so they were also firmly attached.
For that reason, the enemy found them hard to detect.

$ * * * $
Around this time, I met Dr. Phạm Khắc Quảng.

Quảng had been labeled by the enemy as a “trùm chăn” intellectual.
In reality, he did not “hide under the blanket” but actively supported the Kháng chiến.
I will not recount here all his dedicated activities while living in enemy-controlled areas, activities that later led to his being Chairman of the Uỷ ban Mặt trận Tổ quốc of Hà Nội after the liberation of the capital.

I will only tell of my first visit to him at his bookstore on Tràng Thi Street.
The day we had arranged happened to be the day Bảo Đại came to Hà Nội.
Police guarded the streets, including the length of Tràng Thi.
Even so, I went to the shop.
Quảng calmly and cheerfully led me into a back room to talk.

Through later meetings, I learned that, at that time, few people could have imagined that in his home he kept a secret bookcase full of prohibited books in French, many of them published by the French Communist Party.
Because he ran a bookshop and received shipments from France, those banned books were “mixed in” with regular books inside the crates.
Quảng showed me, and lent me to read, journals and books such as Littérature Soviétique (Soviet Literature), La Chute de Paris (The Fall of Paris), La Tempête (The Tempest), and L’étoile (The Star), which would not have been easy to find even in the liberated zones where I had been working.

$ * * * $
In mid-1951, we managed to bring a radio transmitter–receiver into inner Hà Nội and set up an operator for it.

Then one day I received a radio message from Hoàn, calling me back to the base on urgent business, with the instruction that I should return to inner Hà Nội immediately afterward.

By then, our secret liaison routes had been repeatedly attacked and could not be used.
Even if they could, there would be no way to guarantee the timing spelled out in Hoàn’s message.

I discussed the matter with Trình, Ngọc “đen,” and Kim Tấn, and we agreed the only option was to travel openly.
We decided that Hương Kế, a trusted and experienced giao liên, would guide me.
We would use a car borrowed from a base contact, with a reliable driver who was also with us.
The route would go past the Đại Ơn post, across the Bùi River toward Tiến Văn and Hữu Văn, where a liaison station existed, and from there on to Hoàn’s base on road 21.

I reported to Hoàn by radio that I would arrive on time.

One summer morning, a car took me to Hàng Bồ Street, where we entered a large shop.
Ngọc “đen” was already waiting inside.

A few minutes later, a touring car arrived.
On board, besides Hương Kế, were several small children.
When I got in, all the seats were filled.
She had prepared paper horses, paper hats, incense, and votive offerings in a large basket.

The car went through Hà Đông town straight toward Hòa Bình.
After Mai Lĩnh, we reached the Đại Ơn church, where there was a notorious French post, and the car stopped.
We both got out, and the car immediately turned back to Hà Nội.

The post commander at Đại Ơn was a red-faced Frenchman with a thick beard and a pipe clenched in his mouth, standing in front of the post.

We walked straight toward him, our arms full of paper horses, paper hats, and votive offerings.
I greeted him, “Bonjour Monsieur.”
Then we walked past him.
He said nothing at all.
One stage of the journey was safely behind us.

From there, we cut across the fields toward the river.
Seeing no reaction behind us, we kept going until we reached Dót Dét village by the riverbank.
In the hamlet, we inquired about the situation and learned it was calm.
We went down to the ferry landing and crossed the river to Tiến Văn and Hữu Văn, villages in the liberated zone of Chương Mỹ district.
Bá was waiting for me there.

Hương returned via Quảng Bị on her way back to the inner city to report that the trip had gone smoothly.

From Tiến Văn and Hữu Văn, following the Chân Chim and Đồng Mít route, we reached Miếu Môn on road 21, and that very night I arrived at Hoàn’s base.

He had just come back from a meeting with higher-level leaders.
He briefed me on the plan to open the Hà Nam Ninh campaign (Hà Nam, Nam Định, Ninh Bình), while deceiving the enemy into thinking we would attack toward Ứng Hòa and Mỹ Đức in Hà Đông province.

Công an in the inner city, together with the Quận ủy, were tasked with regularly and promptly reporting on the movement of enemy troops and weapons.
The Quận ủy and other sectors were also to prepare propaganda for the coming victories.

The next morning I again took road 21 up to Miếu Môn to return to the inner city.

But this time it would not do to pass via Đại Ơn again.

So we chose the Chuông market route.
Làng Chuông lies just below Đôn Thư—my mother’s native village—so I knew the roads, though I still had to be careful around those who might recognize my face.

Our plan was to cross the Đáy River into Viên Nội village, where we had a liaison base.
From there, a giao liên would guide me openly to road 22.
After that, I would go on my own, taking a public bus to Hà Đông and then a city bus to Hà Nội.

From Miếu Môn, our first stage was to reach Phú Khê and Phú Hữu, a village on the Đáy River in Mỹ Đức district, opposite Viên Nội in Ứng Hòa.
When we arrived, the villagers told us that for several days in a row, Senegalese soldiers had been deployed and spread out along the Viên Nội dyke, thoroughly checking everyone who went to the river.

We used binoculars to see for ourselves and confirmed what the villagers had said.
Watching all day, we saw squads of Senegalese soldiers moving downstream, spreading along the dyke to lie in ambush for several hours.
When they withdrew, they went back the same way, and once one squad had left, another came to replace it.
This went on day and night.

Remembering the failed liaison trip in 1950, Bá grew very uneasy.

I reassured him, saying, “If we keep observing, we will eventually find a gap in their deployment.”

Sure enough, after a day of observation, we saw that each ambush squad left at a fixed time, with a gap before the replacement squad arrived.
Timing it, we found that the ground was left empty for about ten to fifteen minutes.

I asked Bá and Bôn, the liaison team leader with bases in Viên Nội, whether that amount of time was enough to wade the river, cross the dyke, and reach the hamlet where our base was.

We analyzed further.
If we chose midday, the soldiers would be hungry; the outgoing squad would likely leave early, and the incoming squad, having just eaten, would dawdle.
The gap might be even longer.
Moreover, since their deployment began, they had not once had to open fire, so they probably believed that nothing was happening and had grown complacent.

After careful calculation, we decided it was possible.

The next day at noon, we carried out our plan.
Everything unfolded as expected.

Once inside the village, a female giao liên led me along the fields between Viên Nội and Chuông.
Some people were returning home from Chuông market at the same time.
We reached road 22 safely.
Just then, a bus from Vân Đình to Hà Đông arrived, and I got on.

Passing Bình Đà, I saw large enemy tanks lined up side by side under the trees.
I smiled to myself and thought, “They have taken the bait and are reinforcing the wrong sector.”

At Thạch Bích, where there was a notoriously brutal post, the bus stopped.
Passengers had to get off and present their papers to the secret police.
That day I wore large dark glasses like those used by many mật vụ in Hà Nội.
I walked straight up beside the men checking papers, stood with my hands on my hips, and pretended to peer at the passengers’ documents as they passed.
When the last passenger had been checked, I casually climbed back onto the bus.

Not one of the secret policemen checked my papers.

At the Hà Đông bus terminal, I changed to a large city bus to Hà Nội.
By then it was late afternoon, and the bus was already packed.

When we reached the Cửa Nam terminal, now on Hai Bà Trưng Street, I got off and walked some distance to shake off any possible tail.
Feeling that all was clear, I turned into Ngọc “đen”’s base at 11 Phan Bội Châu Street.
I left a brief note there to summon the comrades for an urgent meeting, then waited for nightfall and took a xích lô back to my lodgings.

We had one base contact working at the Đồn Thủy military hospital (now the 108 Hospital).
Wounded and sick enemy soldiers from all over the North were sent there, so our contact could grasp very accurately how the enemy’s forces were deployed throughout the region.
We also had another base contact working as a clerk in the Intendance (French army logistics), so we knew exactly which units were being supplied with weapons and ammunition.

Within just a few days, by radio, we had sent all the necessary information to Hoàn.

There is no need to recall in detail the Hà Nam Ninh victory in 1951, where General de Lattre’s son was killed in action.
I will only add one small, unexpected story of my own.

Some time later, Kim Tấn told me that on the day I rode the bus from Hà Đông to Hà Nội, an old acquaintance of mine from years before had been on the same bus.
He was now a mật thám.
He had recognized me and later told a friend that he did not want to report my presence because he knew my family.
That friend then informed Kim Tấn and warned that, if I really was in the inner city, I should be extremely careful.

It gave me quite a scare.

$ * * * $
Yet even that was not as strange as another encounter I had that same year, right in the heart of Hà Nội.

As part of a program to study the women’s movement in the markets, I went one day to meet a woman base cadre at her home near the cemetery area, on what is now Nguyễn Công Trứ Street.
(The cemetery has since been cleared and replaced by an apartment complex.)
The house shared a common gate with several other small houses, each with a different owner.
I had been there once before, so I knew the way and did not need to ask.

At the appointed time, I pushed my bicycle through the gate.
Before I reached the cadre’s house, I met a man pushing his bicycle out.
We arrived at the gate at the same moment.

I was jolted.
His name was V.
He had worked at the Sở Công an Bắc bộ in 1945–46.
For some time we had had word that he had “dinh tê” and was now a mật thám.
He knew me very well from my days at the Sở Công an.

He had already seen me and stopped his bicycle.
But he stammered, “Who… who are you here to see? I… I’m not home…!”

I did not answer.
If I had spoken, it would have been even easier for him to confirm my identity.

He finished his sentence, then pushed his bicycle out the gate and rode off.

I quickly analyzed the situation.
His panic meant he was afraid of me.
He surely knew that I now headed the Công an Kháng chiến, the force that had eliminated Việt gian inside this very city.
Fearing me, he had left immediately.
He might still go and report to the secret police.

I went straight to the cadre’s house, explained what had just happened, and told her how to respond if questioned.
Then I rode out to Phố Huế, blending into the crowd, and turned into one or two side streets to see if anyone was tailing me.
Seeing nothing suspicious, I stopped at another base and waited until night to return home.

Later, the cadre sent word that V. had asked her whether anyone had come to her house that day.
She told him no, and deliberately suggested that anyone he might have seen had probably come to collect payments at some other house in the alley.

$ * * * $
Afterwards, I often thought about why, on two occasions, enemy agents who knew exactly who I was had either panicked or not dared to have me arrested on the spot.

I can only explain it through another story, also true.

In 1948, the Nha Công an invited the poet Lan Sơn to write about Công an work.
He spent some time working with us at Công an Hà Nội.

By 1952, I was informed that Lan Sơn had returned to the inner city and was teaching at a private school called Minh Tân.
At that time, Trần Vân, a Công an officer from Hà Nội, was “going social” to work under legal cover in the inner city.
I arranged for him to study at Hàn Thuyên School while also taking a job, which turned out to be at Minh Tân.
(Trần Vân later became a Đại tá An ninh and is now retired.)

At that time, I was still in charge of Công chức vận—work among civil servants—in the inner city.
I thought we might persuade Lan Sơn to take part in our efforts, because I believed he was not opposed to the Cách mạng.

I wrote him a personal letter and asked Trần Vân to deliver it, proposing a meeting.
He agreed, and gave me the address of his rented room on the upper floor of a house on Quán Thánh Street.

On the appointed night, in the rain, I rode there by bicycle.
After I entered the room, Lan Sơn stepped out onto the balcony to look around, then came back in.
Before we talked about anything else, he asked his first question in French: “Tu as ton garde-corps là-bas?”

By that he meant, “You have your bodyguard nearby, don’t you?”
He clearly assumed that, as a senior Công an cadre, I must have such protection.

I did not answer.
It was better to let him feel reassured.

In reality, revolutionaries working underground in enemy territory could not possibly have a bodyguard tagging along everywhere they went.

$ * * * $
Still, those two chance encounters with known enemy agents who either panicked or did not dare report me could not be explained by any scruples on their part.
The explanation must be similar to what lay behind Lan Sơn’s question.

In other words, they assumed that I always had a bodyguard with me.
If they made a move against me, they would be the first to suffer the consequences.

$ * * * $
Such was the way the people living under enemy control sheltered and helped me.

And such was the protective force of the Kháng chiến, even in the enemy’s own stronghold.

$ * * * $
In my thoughts, I always cherish a vivid image of the Công an giao liên fighters, both men and women, in those years of Kháng chiến.

Hà Nội, 6 September 1996
