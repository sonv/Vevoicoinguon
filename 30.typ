= 30. Tết Tears

I have lived through many Tết holidays, in many periods of my life, and in many different circumstances.
From the Tết of my childhood, surrounded by family.
To the Tết of my years in the revolutionary movement, far from home, but happy among comrades and the people — whether in the free zones of the North, or the liberated areas of the South.
Tết in temporarily occupied Hà Nội.
Tết Mậu Thân in the middle of Sài Gòn.
Tết in prison.
Each Tết carried its own character.

But there has never been a Tết with as many tears as the story I recount below.

$ * * * $

After the liberation of the South and the reunification of the country, the beginning of 1976 brought me a Tết once again spent in the warm atmosphere of family — after eleven years apart, a separation I once feared would never end.
It was during that very Tết that something unexpected happened.

Hằng, my cousin who worked at the Hydrometeorology Service, sent word to me.
She said someone she knew, having heard I had returned to the North, wished to meet me about a family matter.
She did not mention a name.
It made me wonder all day who it could be.

On the afternoon of the second day of Tết.

I had just seen off some friends visiting for the holiday.
Then the doorbell rang.
A woman in her forties stepped inside.
Her face looked vaguely familiar — some features seemed unchanged — but I still could not recall exactly who she was.

As soon as she sat down, she burst into tears.
Through sobs, she said, “I am the wife of anh Chi…”
Then she wept again.

At once, images and events from twenty-five years earlier came flooding back before my eyes.

$ * * * $

In 1951.
Inside Hà Nội.
The city still under temporary occupation.
A multi-household dwelling near the end of phố Xăng-xôm (now Triệu Việt Vương).

I went there for the first time at dusk, carrying a small wooden box tied with cord.
After handing the box to the man who answered the door and gave the correct password, I arranged the next meeting and left to reach the car waiting near the wall of Nhà Diêm.

Inside that wooden box was a homemade radio transmitter.
Anh Trần Quốc Hoàn, Secretary of the Hà Nội Special Zone Party Committee, had given it to anh Trần Sâm for use inside the city.
Whether due to unfamiliarity or mechanical fault, the device had never managed to make contact with the base.
When I met anh Sâm, he complained about it and asked me to send it out to the base for repairs.
I agreed, without revealing that I already knew someone in the city capable of fixing it.

The handover itself was almost comical.

According to plan, I went to phố Phủ Doãn, to a motorcycle repair shop — a liaison point for anh Sâm.
I handed the owner a note with the simple signal: “Deliver the repaired vehicle to the bearer.”
Without a word, he gave me a newspaper-wrapped bundle.

I stepped outside, heading toward the car waiting on the corner of Tràng Thi.
But something felt wrong.

Anh Sâm had told me the transmitter was in a small, light wooden box.
Yet this bundle felt heavy and round, like a roll of giò lụa.
I returned to the shop.
I said, “Mine was light — why is this so heavy?”
Calmly, he answered, “Grenades. If they weren’t heavy, what would they be?”

Of course I had no business receiving grenades.
He had mixed up someone else’s package.
I handed it back and left.

When I told anh Sâm, he confirmed the mistake.
Through anh Ngọc “đen,” a security officer, the correct device was finally sent to me.

Meanwhile, inside the city, we had a talented radio technician — an employee in the Météo office of the occupation administration.
He was already a covert intelligence source, providing valuable information.
Brave enough to repair a prohibited device at home, he agreed to help, hiding it among various radios and spare parts scattered openly on his workbench.

That man was anh Chi.

From that time on, I visited him occasionally for political discussion and operational matters.
His wife understood the risks he took; yet whenever I came, she was warm, steady, and discreetly kept watch outside so we could talk.
Once, after a quarrel, she even “reported” anh Chi to me.
I advised him not to strike his wife.
He listened.
Their home returned to harmony.

Later, as newer American transmitters were brought into the city, the older homemade unit remained hidden in his house.
We simply told him to find a safe place to keep it.

$ * * * $

Now I realized: the woman before me truly was his wife — the wife of the intelligence source who, twenty-five years ago, had taken the risk of repairing that transmitter.
No wonder I had not recognized her at first — hardship had taken its toll.

But why was she crying during Tết?

I calmed her and asked her to tell me everything.

$ * * * $

She said:

“I knew that in July 1954, my husband and several others in the intelligence group were transferred from Hà Nội Public Security to the Central Intelligence Service.
Anh Chúc accepted the new mission and went South.
My husband did not want to go — partly because of family, partly because he longed to live in an atmosphere of freedom after years under occupation.

Just before the liberation of Hà Nội, the intelligence people gave him a radio transmitter belonging to chị Vân to repair.
But no one came back to pick it up.
He hid it in the ceiling and then forgot about it after liberation.

In 1965, someone denounced him.
Security forces searched the house and found the transmitter.
They accused him of espionage and arrested him.”

She paused, then continued:

“At that time, I worked in a factory.
The Party cell had planned to admit me as a member.
When my husband was arrested, the Secretary called me in.
He said: ‘If you divorce him, you may still be admitted.
Otherwise, no.’

I told him: ‘We have lived together for many years.
I believe he is not a spy.
Even during the occupation, he worked secretly for the Resistance — cadres came to our home.
If necessary, ask them.
I cannot divorce him.’”

Her voice shook again.

“The children were shunned at school.
Life became very hard.
I had no one to turn to.
Later, for reasons I still do not know, my husband was released — but the document only said ‘temporarily released,’ not cleared.
He lost his job.
He struggled to find odd work to feed the family.
Then one day, he was struck by a car and passed away.”

She broke down once more.

$ * * * $

I had left for the South in 1964.
From there, the Central Office for Security communicated with the Ministry every day by radio.
Many questions about old matters were sent in for me to answer.
But this case had never been mentioned.

She continued:

“Someone told me you had returned from the South.
Through chị Hằng, I found a way to reach you.
I hoped you still remembered and could speak for him.”

$ * * * $

I am not someone who forgets.
Nor someone ungrateful.

I consoled her, asked her to go home, and wait for news.

$ * * * $

After Tết, at the office, I requested to read the entire case file.
Then I invited the veteran Public Security officers who had worked with the wartime intelligence group, including those who knew anh Chi.
Everyone agreed: the group was reliable, and anh Chi even more so.

I asked the officer who handled the case:
“When I was in the South, the Ministry still communicated with me directly by radio.
There were matters only I knew.
Why was this case never sent in for clarification?”
He answered vaguely.

I said:
“If you made a mistake, then say so.
You arrested him wrongly.
Why was he released only as ‘temporarily released’?”
No one could answer.

We drafted a formal record, signed by all present.
It was sent to the department responsible.
I insisted they issue a written document clearing anh Chi’s name.

Yet nothing moved.
Weeks passed.
Months passed.
Almost a year.

In the end, I had to write directly to the responsible superior.
Formally, I stated:
“For justice, and for the humane policy owed to someone who served the Resistance inside occupied Hà Nội, the facts are clear.
If you do not resolve this, I must report directly to the Minister.”

And that is what I did.

Why?
The reason was obvious.

When Minister Trần Quốc Hoàn read my report and reviewed the file, he exclaimed:
“How could anyone treat such a person that way?”

He immediately ordered the department head to issue the exoneration.
He also instructed staff to go directly to the neighborhood committee to publicly announce the clearing of his name.

$ * * * $

Another Tết came.
Without notice, chị Chi visited my home again.
Through tears, she told me what had happened since the exoneration.

She no longer worked at the factory.
But now, neighbors treated her family with respect.
Old colleagues visited to share her joy.
Her children were welcomed again at school, admitted into the Young Pioneer and Youth Union.

She thanked me.
I replied only that I had done my duty.
And I regretted that my eleven years in the South had prevented me from helping her sooner.

She cried again.
But I knew these were no longer tears of injustice.

$ * * * $

I am not one who cries aloud.
But my eyes stung.

Perhaps those tears she shed were, in a way, a precious reward from the people — given to someone like me in Public Security.

In a lifetime of serving in this work, how many officers ever receive tears like those, freely offered, on a Tết I will never forget?

Hà Nội, 2 November 1996.

(1) Nhà Diêm:
This area lay on the southeastern side of the Thăng Long citadel.
In September of the Year of the Dog (1154), King Lý Anh Tông (1138–1175) built the Nam Giao altar here for the Heaven-worship ceremony.
In 1890, the land containing the Nam Giao altar was handed over to a company to build a match factory.
In 1956, the Trần Hưng Đạo Mechanical Plant was constructed on the same site.
From 2004 onward, the plant was relocated to make room for the Vincom Bà Triệu commercial center.
