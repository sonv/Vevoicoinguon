= 21. The hearts of the Southern people

Speaking broadly about the South, there are countless good things that could be said.
And even if one keeps speaking, it would still be incomplete.

So let me begin with my first reflections on the deep affection that the people of the South had for the revolution, shown concretely in the way they supported the cadres and fighters resisting the Americans at that time.

$ * * * $

At the end of March 1964, by sea, on one of the unnumbered ships, I arrived in the South to take part directly in the resistance against the Americans.
The first place I set foot in the South was Rạch Gốc, in the Cà Mau cape region.
From there, I traveled across the Southern plains to reach the base of the Trung ương Cục miền Nam, then located in the Dương Minh Châu war zone of Tây Ninh Province.

Leaving Khu 9, the local comrades arranged for me to travel with a group of cadres from the region who were going to study at the Party school of the Trung ương Cục.
They did this so that if anything happened along the way, I would have comrades to assist me.
In those days, even cadres returning from the resistance had to keep their identities secret — let alone reinforcements from the North who still spoke with a strong Northern accent.

At each rest stop along the route, the comrades in the group reminded me to speak as little as possible to avoid drawing attention.
The appearance of a cadre who spoke such distinct Northern Vietnamese, traveling from Khu 9 toward the forests, might reveal the existence of the Hồ Chí Minh trail at sea.

But none of that could fool the children — and especially not the Má.

On the day we were about to leave Cù Lao Long Phú to continue our journey, the representative of the Women’s Association said they had prepared a small farewell gathering for us.
The Má had pooled money to make bánh xèo, a favorite dish.

At the start, one of the Má stood up and said:
“Today you children leave your families and your Tổ quốc to go fight for the liberation of the people, so the local Women’s Association has prepared this little gathering to wish you strength on your journey …”

Hearing this, anh Hai Hồng — my peer and close friend — nudged me with his elbow and winked with a smile.

After the meal, the comrades in the group all said:
“Today the Má mainly wanted Tư Trọng to eat bánh xèo — the rest of us only got to eat alongside.”

I did not understand what they meant until the comrades explained:

People in the Khu 9 region often considered this place to be Vietnam.
Anything farther out — whether Central or North — they called Huế.
So when the Má said “leaving your families, leaving your Tổ quốc,” she really meant:
“You are the one who has come all the way from that distant Tổ quốc Huế to Vietnam to fight.”

Later, during the eleven years I worked in Nam Bộ, I — like all other comrades, whether originally from the North or the South — was sheltered, cared for, and protected by the people of the South.
And the more one was from the North, the more affection one received.

It was not only in the liberated communes of Củ Chi, where we had our headquarters for many years, but also in rural areas such as Trảng Bàng (Tây Ninh), Đức Hòa (Long An), Gò Đen (Long An), Cai Lậy (Tiền Giang), Mỏ Cày and Châu Thành (Bến Tre); or in Bà Điểm (Hóc Môn) near Sài Gòn, and even in the inner city itself — everywhere my comrades and I received protection and wholehearted help from people who had never been related to us in any way.

There was one quite special and moving story that I have never forgotten.
After the enemy bulldozed and wiped out the ten liberated communes of northern Củ Chi at the end of 1967 — just as we were preparing intensively for the Mậu Thân 1968 offensive — we had to temporarily stay in An Ninh Commune, Đức Hòa, Long An.
At that time we needed to buy a boat to carry weapons into the inner city of Sài Gòn.
I assigned anh Bảy Bình to use false papers to go to Đức Hòa town to find one.

While looking around, he was stopped by a patrol, questioned, and held for document checking.
His companion hurried back to the base to sound the alarm.
But only a short while later, anh Bảy Bình returned safely.

When asked what had happened, we learned this:

As soon as the soldiers took his papers, the local people gathered around and surrounded them.
Some said, “This man is just doing business, buying a boat — why are you seizing his papers and trying to arrest him?”
Others were even bolder; one reached straight into the soldier’s pocket and pulled out the fake ID belonging to anh Bảy Bình.
Then some people blocked the soldiers, while others led anh Bảy Bình to the xe lam stop and helped him board a vehicle heading back to Trảng Bàng.
At the boundary of An Ninh Commune, the person escorting him told him to get off, while he himself continued on.

In the end, anh Bảy Bình never learned the names of those who saved him; and the people never asked who he was or what unit he belonged to.
Such is the heart of the people toward the revolution.

There was also a humorous story.
At that time, after Mậu Thân 1968, the enemy was rapidly “pacifying” the countryside.
We went to Định Thủy Commune, Mỏ Cày, Bến Tre — a weakly held area because it was close to the enemy.
I told the protection team to keep their weapons hidden but within easy reach, so as not to bring trouble to the household.

The houses in the hamlet were cramped, with only one bed, reserved for old ông Hai.
His children came during the day to take care of him and then slept in huts out in the fields at night to avoid artillery fire.
At night, my comrades slung hammocks among the coconut trees.
As for me, to avoid unexpected rain, I hung my hammock under the roof of the pigsty.

After the first night passed, on the second night, as I was about to go to sleep, I heard ông Hai calling out loudly, “Where’s Ba? Where’s chú Ba?”
At first I thought he was calling someone else.
Then the protection comrades told me he was calling for me.
I entered the house and ông Hai told me I must not sleep in the pigsty, but come share the bed with him.
No matter how I refused, he would not let me.

That bed had always been off limits — even his grandchildren were not allowed to lie on it, not even for a moment.
It should be noted that ông Hai was Catholic, and whenever artillery fell nearby, he refused to go into the shelter, saying “earth must not be above my head.”
Sometimes he even went into the yard to light incense at the altar.
Such was the affection ông Hai had for us cadres.

In Định Thủy as well, so many people helped us with all their hearts.
Although we were T4 cadres, not T2 ones.
At chị Ba’s house, where we stayed for long periods; and ông Tư, ông Sáu, and ông Chín — they never hesitated to escort cadres on open routes, and many times used their own boats, disguised, to carry weapons from the border back to Bến Tre for our unit.

Such were the people of the Xứ Dừa of chị Ba Định.

In the inner city, even under strict enemy control, many families who knew we were resistance cadres still sheltered and hid us.
After the first and second Mậu Thân offensives, there was one family whose house the An ninh T4 armed reconnaissance team had used as a weapons cache.
Unfortunately, the comrade responsible for that cache was killed, and no one in the unit knew the location to reestablish contact.
Yet, on the day Sài Gòn was completely liberated, that family invited the unit to come and handed over the entire weapons cache intact.

If the enemy had caught anyone keeping weapons in their house, they would have been imprisoned for at least ten years.
But the family preserved the cache safely for seven years.
Truly silent devotion to the revolution — and truly remarkable courage.

On 30 April 1975, a unit of our troops freed me from the Mỹ–ngụy prison at 3 Bạch Đằng.
I was making my way back to a safe house, with not a single đồng in my pocket, wearing borrowed clothes, my beard and hair unkempt.

On the street, I met two young women.
Seeing that I looked unusual, they asked after me.
When they learned my situation, they brought me onto a bus headed for chợ Bến Thành, then said goodbye — but not before buying me the next bus ticket and asking an elderly woman traveling the same route to tell me when to get off at Bình Thới.
To this day, I still keep that bus ticket and the few hundred đồng they gave me.
Sadly, I never learned the names of those kind-hearted young women.

On the night of 1 May 1975, I slept at the house of anh chị Ba Trương in Bình Thới.
Their house had been burned by the enemy during the second Mậu Thân offensive.
It was raining heavily, and water leaked everywhere; only one spot in the house remained dry.
Anh chị Ba insisted that I sleep there.
Fearing the area was still unsafe, anh Ba and his son stood guard in case bad elements came to harm me.
How could I sleep?
So we all stayed awake, sitting together around the dry spot, talking until morning.
I had known that house only since the first Mậu Thân offensive.
Yet our bond was already so deep — that is the heart of the people toward the revolution.

$ * * * $

As for me, I can only recount a few stories as examples.
If we were to record all the stories told by all the cadres and liberation fighters over the long years from 1954 to 1975, we would need many large volumes to capture the heart of the Southern people toward the revolution.

This was a decisive factor in the victory of the Southern Revolution — something the Mỹ–ngụy forces never had, and could never have.
Their failure was, above all, because they did not have the people’s support.

That too was one of the great lessons of my revolutionary life.
