= 29. Independence Palace, May 1, 1975

Around noon on 30 April 1975, a battalion of our troops advanced into the 3 Bạch Đằng area and freed me from the prison of the Central Intelligence of the Sài Gòn regime.
Comrade Du, the battalion commander, took me to the place where his unit’s command was stationed, at the former Navy Headquarters on Bạch Đằng street.
That afternoon, the brothers shared dry rations and canned food with me.
We talked throughout the night.
They asked about my imprisonment and about Sài Gòn, and told me about their fighting and the situation in the North.
I asked anh Du to help deliver a letter to the Thành ủy Sài Gòn.

On the morning of 1 May 1975, anh Du told me:
“Our unit has to continue marching.
If we bring you along and something happens, it would be a pity.
So I will hand you over to another unit staying in Sài Gòn, so you can meet the Uỷ ban Quân quản and the Thành ủy.”

Then anh Du drove me by jeep to Dinh Độc Lập.
Along the road, weapons, ammunition, and the uniforms of ngụy soldiers lay scattered.
On this first day of liberated Sài Gòn, the streets were full of people and vehicles.
The regime’s “cảnh sát công lộ” had likely disappeared.
At intersections, people avoided each other on their own, and traffic kept flowing.

Near Dinh Độc Lập, the crowd was dense.
After weaving for a long time, the jeep reached the fence.
Anh Du asked a soldier on guard to go inside and report that he needed to make contact.
A moment later, anh Du went in first.
I remained outside the fence to wait.
It gave me a chance to see and hear things never seen under Mỹ–ngụy rule, and unlikely ever to happen again at Dinh Độc Lập.

People around me said to each other:
“In the past, you had to sneak past here.
A barbed-wire line forced everyone far from the fence; no one could come close or gather like today.”

Many red banners were raised, with slogans such as “Chào mừng Uỷ ban Quân quản” and “Chào mừng ngày 1/5,” likely prepared by our cơ sở nội thành.

The iron gate of Dinh Độc Lập, having been rammed down, could no longer be closed.
Our troops placed several soldiers there to guard.

An older man was asking a soldier about his hometown and education.
He turned to the person next to him and said:
“They talked about a bloodbath.
These Northern soldiers—tú tài level, and gentle.”

Another man, together with a monk and a priest, asked another soldier questions, and seemed satisfied with the answers about policies toward intellectuals and religion in the North.

Someone else, after learning that a soldier was a platoon leader, told a companion:
“Officers and soldiers are the same; the only difference is an extra pistol.”

A middle-aged woman kept stroking a soldier’s shirt and told another woman:
“In the past, when ‘the troops’ were about to go on a sweep, they came to take from us.
These Giải phóng soldiers only thank you politely, then set up their own pot to cook.”

Looking inside the fence of Dinh Độc Lập, the scene was truly unique.

In the yard, here and there, large pots of rice were steaming.
A few tanks stood in place.
On the lawn, soldiers gathered in small groups, lying down to rest.

Anh Du and another cadre came out to get me.
Anh Du returned to his unit.
I followed the cadre into the compound.

Talking with the soldiers, I learned they had rushed in by motorized convoy from Đà Nẵng, fighting along the way.
They had marched day and night without rest.
They were sleepy, but now too happy to sleep.
After constant movement, they had not been able to bathe.
Here, with water available, they washed freely, which explained the clothes drying everywhere and on the grass.
Some soldiers were bathing under the fountain at the “phủ đầu rồng” in the courtyard.

At the same time, reporters with cameras hanging from their necks were hurrying to find out which tank had entered first and who had planted the flag.
On the front steps, cameramen were filming a unit running into the main building with a flag.
I learned that another unit had been assigned to take the palace, so the reporters had followed that one.
But that unit met heavy resistance and was delayed.
Under orders, whichever unit reached the palace first entered.
Thus the unit that actually took the palace had no photographers with them, and now the reporters were searching for them to document it.

The sun was harsh.
Seeing I was still weak, the soldiers told me to rest inside.

The basement of the building served as the command post of the unit that had taken Dinh Độc Lập.
There was also an advance team preparing for the Uỷ ban Quân quản.
Representatives of the Uỷ ban had not yet arrived, but many people were already asking to enter to greet them, and the soldiers had to postpone these requests.

By noon, the soldiers shared their meal with me.
I learned that the entire Cabinet of Dương Văn Minh was still being held upstairs.
Since noon the previous day, they had not eaten.
They could not eat our dry rations and canned food.
The soldiers therefore took a truck, brought along a former ngụy officer stationed inside the palace, and went out to buy food for them.

By late afternoon, the representatives of the Uỷ ban Quân quản still had not arrived.
The officer in charge of the advance team told me to return to an old cơ sở for the moment, and I could meet the Uỷ ban later.

That night, 1 May 1975, I slept at the home of anh chị Ba Trương in Bình Thới.
Their house had been burned during the second phase of Mậu Thân.
It rained heavily and leaked everywhere; there was only one dry spot.
They insisted I sleep there.
Worried the area was not secure, anh Ba and a nephew kept watch.
I could not sleep.
So everyone stayed awake, gathered around the dry spot, talking until morning.

The next morning, chị Ba went to the market to prepare a meal to celebrate my release.
A car stopped in front of the house.
The person running in was Nhơn, their eldest son.
During the second phase of Mậu Thân, he had left home for the liberated zone and joined our unit; later he was selected by anh Sáu Dân to join his protection unit.

Seeing me, he hugged me tightly and cried, saying everyone had thought I was dead.
He said he had come to Sài Gòn with chú Sáu, and that chú Sáu had allowed him to visit home briefly.
He said he would immediately inform anh Sáu Dân.

A few hours later, the sound of a police siren came.
Anh chị Ba feared the ngụy might still cause trouble and told me to hide.
The car stopped right outside.
Footsteps rushed in.
Voices asked urgently, “Where is Tư Trọng?”

Anh Ba panicked and tried to block them from going inside.
Looking through the curtain, I saw it was anh Hai Sơn, then anh Sáu Ngọc.
I stepped out and reassured anh Ba that they were our own people.

It turned out that after hearing from Nhơn, anh Sáu Dân had ordered the An ninh team to fetch me immediately in case anything happened.
But their sudden arrival had frightened the family.

Those were the scenes I witnessed in the first days of a newly liberated Sài Gòn.
They have remained deeply imprinted in my memory.
