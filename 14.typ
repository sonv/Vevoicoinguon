= 14. A Struggle

Trần Quốc Hoàn was reassigned by the Central Committee to serve as Vice Minister of Thứ bộ Công an.
So Lê Thanh Nghị, then Bí thư Liên khu ủy Ba, concurrently served as Bí thư Đặc khu ủy Hà Nội.
The Standing Committee of Đặc khu Hà Nội, around 1954, was headquartered in the Xích Thổ area, now Hoàng Long district.

Around June 1954, a representative of the Central Committee arrived in Liên khu Ba and convened a meeting with delegates from Khu Tả Ngạn and Đặc khu Hà Nội.
The purpose was to inform us about the upcoming Geneva Agreement, particularly the temporary division of Việt Nam into two regions.

The Geneva Agreement was signed.
The French military immediately withdrew from Nam Định and Phủ Lý.
Trần Quốc Hoàn sent a telegram assigning me to meet Công an Khu Tả Ngạn and Hải Phòng to relay several operational directives.

Just as I returned to our unit, the Standing Committee instructed us to relocate the entire base to the area along Route 1, within the districts of Phú Xuyên and Thường Tín.
We had barely finished the move when another directive arrived: I was to join the Hà Nội delegation going up to Việt Bắc to attend a training course in preparation for taking over Hà Nội.

The site chosen was the cải cách ruộng đất school in Đại Từ district.
There I met Trần Danh Tuyên, newly appointed as Bí thư Thành ủy Hà Nội by the Central Committee.
We were discussing the course curriculum when one day Tuyên and I were told to report to the Ban Bí thư Trung ương Đảng for instructions.

When we arrived, we ran into Song Hào and Lê Quang Đạo.
They were working with the Central Joint Commission for the Ceasefire, headed by Văn Tiến Dũng on the Vietnamese side.
That noon, I was ordered to follow Song Hào and Lê Quang Đạo to receive a new assignment.

I already knew Song Hào from Tân Trào before the August Revolution.
As for Lê Quang Đạo, he had been Bí thư Thành ủy Hà Nội, and I had worked with him for many years.
Carrying nothing prepared, I rode with them in a jeep toward Phủ Lỗ on the Thái Nguyên road.

That evening, Văn Tiến Dũng assigned the tasks.

Only then did I learn that the Geneva Agreement contained a provision unprecedented anywhere in the world.
Two countries at war, once agreeing to a ceasefire, were to transfer cities to each other peacefully.

Văn Tiến Dũng tasked me to work directly with Lê Quang Đạo to study the Agreement in preparation for negotiations with the French.
For Hà Nội, the Agreement included military transfer and administrative transfer.

After hearing my assessment, Văn Tiến Dũng approved the proposal to withdraw Trần Vỹ—also from Thành ủy Hà Nội—who had been assigned to the Hà Văn Lâu delegation inside Hà Nội, and bring him back to the Central Joint Commission.
That way, Thành ủy Hà Nội had two members participating here: Trần Vỹ for military transfer, and I for administrative transfer.

The subcommittee for Hà Nội under the Central Joint Commission consisted essentially of two working teams: one for military transfer, one for administrative transfer.
The military transfer involved mapping out the withdrawal schedule of French forces and defining the lines our forces would move to.
The administrative transfer, as written in the Geneva Agreement, consisted of only a few sentences, including the key points “ensure administrative continuity” and “an advance administrative team shall enter first.”

The French side assigned De Bresson, legal adviser of the French Embassy in Sài Gòn.
I returned to Thành ủy to request several specialists from various sectors who were attending the training course.

Upon return, I learned that the Central Committee had reassigned Trần Quốc Hoàn to serve as Bí thư Thành ủy Hà Nội.
He assigned to me lawyer Dương Văn Đàm for legal expertise, along with several others—I still remember Bùi Văn Các—each with specialized knowledge.

At the first joint meeting, both sides admitted frankly that nothing like this had ever happened anywhere in the world.
We asked the other to present their views first.
Văn Tiến Dũng had already instructed me to let the French speak first, so we could study their position and refine our own accordingly.

During negotiations, Thành ủy Hà Nội continually sent me reports from the inner city.
We learned that, besides forcibly moving civilians south, the French were also shipping large quantities of machinery, documents, and equipment from offices to the South.
Meanwhile, the workers and staff under our influence were hiding items so they could be returned after liberation.

Studying the Geneva text, I saw clearly the clause requiring “no interruption to administrative work.”
In meetings, I strongly criticized the French for violating the Agreement.
At first they denied it, but eventually they admitted it—though they argued that only regularly operating offices had to comply.

I pointed out that the only intermittently operating office in any country is the National Assembly—yet Hà Nội had no National Assembly building.
I told De Bresson: “You are the legal adviser of the French Embassy, and you make such a statement. I ask permission to broadcast your words on radio.”

Knowing they would be disgraced if we publicized it, the French returned to the next session saying they “did not oppose compensation for removed assets” and blamed “forces beyond their control.”
Seizing on that, I insisted that this position be written into the administrative transfer agreement.

As for the “advance administrative team,” neither side yet knew what it would entail.
We kept the wording straight from the Geneva Agreement.
But when it came to implementation, the French asked us to specify our plan.
I said we would send a small group about ten days in advance.
They agreed.

However, when Công an Hà Nội compiled a list from the city’s telephone directory showing hundreds of agencies, Thành ủy instructed me to raise the number to several dozen.
The French again agreed.

Right before signing the agreement, Thành ủy instructed me to raise it again—this time to over one hundred people—to ensure each office had at least one or two staff members.
At the meeting, I told the French, “We have a minor supplementary detail,” and they agreed to hear it.
When I presented the need for over one hundred personnel, they said they needed approval from higher-ups—but finally agreed.
After all, the whole matter had no precedent in the world.

In the final days of drafting and signing, the French attempted a few last disturbances, but finally the agreement was signed.
That same afternoon, the advance administrative team departed for Hà Nội.

Around one hundred specialists had gathered at Phủ Lỗ.
We briefed them on the agreement and emphasized the importance of creating handover minutes at each office, with attached asset inventories.
Thành ủy Hà Nội appointed Trần Danh Tuyên—then Phó Bí thư Thành ủy and officially Vice Chairman of the Military Administration Committee—as head of the team; I was deputy.

Doctor Hoàng Đình Cầu was tasked with securing accommodations for the whole group.
He proposed using the De Lanessan Hospital—now Military Hospital 108—because all French wounded had already left; the buildings were spacious and only needed cleaning.
His suggestion was approved.

On the evening of 2 October 1954, French transport trucks carried our advance team from Phủ Lỗ into Hà Nội.
They did this because the agreement had only just been signed that afternoon, and because bringing us in at night reduced negative political impact for them.

Beginning 3 October 1954, our specialists were escorted to Hà Nội’s administrative offices.
Workers and staff there helped us by providing original inventory lists.
We required the French to produce current lists for comparison, forming the basis for future compensation claims.
We also used the telephone network—already under our quiet control—to coordinate between offices and our team at De Lanessan Hospital.
By 9 October 1954, the work was complete.

On 10 October 1954, everyone knew what would happen next.

Immediately after the liberation of Hà Nội, I was assigned to continue working at the Central Joint Commission for the Ceasefire.
My tasks included drafting the agreement on the 300-day transition zone, and working on the compensation subcommittee.

As my duties in Hà Nội increased, I eventually handed the compensation work over to Dương Văn Đàm, who continued until the French finally signed compensation documents worth several million French francs—I no longer remember the exact amount.

Forty years have passed.
Our first daughter, born during that time, was named Hòa Bình.
She turns forty this year.

I still remember that after 19 December 1946, there was a song that ended with the words: “Tomorrow we will return to the Capital…”

Those children of Hà Nội, those who fought for Hà Nội and for the whole country, kept their pledge from the first day of the national resistance against French colonial invasion.

That night of 2 October 1954, in the trucks carrying the advance administrative team into Hà Nội, many quietly wept on the road back to the city—before the official takeover.

Hà Nội, 1994

(1) Thứ bộ Công an was the initial name for the Nha Công an, split off from the old Bộ Nội vụ.
Only in late August 1953 was it renamed Bộ Công an.
