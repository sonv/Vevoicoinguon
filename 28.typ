= 28. Tết in the prisons of the Mỹ–Ngụy
People often say: “A day in prison is like a thousand years outside.”

I was arrested and imprisoned for exactly four years, four months, and ten days; and I was held in solitary confinement from beginning to end.

It began in Bến Tre, then they transferred me to Cần Thơ, then to Bình Đức, and finally to Sài Gòn until I was released.

In Sài Gòn, whenever they tortured me, they sent me to the detention center on Trần Bình Trọng street; the rest of the time I was in 3 Bạch Đằng.

Every time they escorted me, they blindfolded me, sometimes even stuffed my ears tight, and of course shackled both hands and feet.

They moved me at night, for hours, and only when putting me into a cell would they remove the blindfold and the earplugs.

On the day of liberation, I finally saw that the rooms they had kept me in — which I had thought were separated by who-knows-how many kilometers — were all within the compound of 3 Bạch Đằng, some only about twenty meters apart.

The first Tết I spent in prison was early 1971.

At that time the enemy still did not know my true identity.

I was held in the last solitary cell of the row.

At night, sewer rats the size of kittens ran out from somewhere and bumped into me.

During the days of Tết, the guards all took time off.

One afternoon, reflected through shards of glass embedded in the wall as spikes, a beam of sunlight suddenly shone into my cell; a round white spot, moving slowly.

I sat watching that ray of sunlight.

And that became the idea for a poem I attempted to write in prison, titled “NẮNG” (“SUNLIGHT”), with the following lines:

“Hôm nay lần đầu tiên
Có nắng rọi trong phòng
Ngoài kia chắc nắng đẹp
Chan hòa nắng tươi vui.

Xà lim chiều vắng lạnh
Không tỏa hết bàn tay
Trườn trên tường đốm nắng
Như sức sống long lanh.

Giơ tay mừng đón nắng
Lòng những tưởng bồi hồi
Miền Cờ Sao nắng đẹp
Sức sống bay thăm tôi”.

During that same Tết, one night, for reasons I still do not know, a few guards secretly turned on our radio — I could not tell whether it was đài Hà Nội or đài Giải Phóng.

Suddenly, I overheard part of a commentary praising our Giải phóng quân for fighting well and winning big on Đường 9 – Nam Lào.

My heart filled with indescribable joy.

That truly was a Tết gift for me that spring.

After that, for various reasons, the enemy discovered my true identity.

They tortured me relentlessly from March 1971 until November 1971.

Only later did I learn that, outside, there had been a plan to release an American POW and propose exchanging me before the conclusion of the Paris Conference.

Although the torture stopped, the Americans still tried to interrogate me for information; of course, I had to defend against any slip that could harm us.

In 1972, they put me in a specially designed cell.

It was about four square meters, with a steel door lined with rubber for soundproofing: electricity, water, even air were all controlled by them from the outside; the walls were painted stark white to create psychological pressure, and five lightbulbs burned day and night so the prisoner could not distinguish day from night.

After 30/4/1975, our technical officers examined the cell and found hidden microphones in the walls, and on the ceiling an infrared camera that allowed them to monitor my movements at any moment.

There was only a bird-cage slot for receiving food.

Guards were not allowed to speak to the prisoner.

Toward the end of 1972, probably near Tết, the American interrogator — seeing no benefit in continuing — threatened to hand me back to the ngụy, implying renewed torture, hoping to force me to talk.

One night, while asleep, I suddenly heard a loud explosion, surely hitting near the prison compound.

I knew it was our artillery.

When I was captured, it was during the period when the enemy was carrying out “rapid pacification of the countryside” after Mậu Thân 1968; at that time I was in Mỏ Cày, Bến Tre, and had seen Nguyễn Văn Thiệu’s helicopter land to celebrate their “pacification” of Bến Tre.

So now, hearing our heavy shells reaching Sài Gòn, I immediately sensed that their “pacification” had failed.

The sound of our artillery exploding inside Sài Gòn made me think of it as the voice of comrades and compatriots, signaling that the balance of the war had shifted.

And that became the subject for another poem I attempted, titled “Tiếng người” (“The Voice of the People”), expressing my wish at the time — that I might become the target for our artillery gunners to strike directly at the enemy’s headquarters; and even if I were to die, when victory came, comrades would still be able to distinguish the body of a revolutionary from that of the enemy.

Early 1973, just before Tết, the American interrogator informed me that the Paris Agreement had been signed; but he said he did not yet know what would happen to me.

Seeing I was not being released, I protested in many ways, but they continued holding me in solitary confinement, refusing to move me to the section with other POWs.

Late 1974, I protested and criticized them not only for violating the Paris Agreement by not releasing me, but also for their inhumanity — keeping me from sunlight for years.

Cornered, they allowed me “sunbathing”.

But after a few sessions, they suddenly stopped.

Only after liberation did I learn that at that time our forces had struck Buôn Ma Thuột, and the enemy retaliated against the prisoners.

Right until I was freed from the Mỹ–ngụy prison on 30/4/1975, I was told by our leaders that the American–ngụy command had ordered my execution, but the lower-level guards — later confessing this during their cải tạo — did not dare carry it out because our forces were already near.

Had they killed me as planned, I would never have had the chance to write down the poems I had composed in prison and memorized; nor could I have recounted these Tết memories from the Mỹ–ngụy prisons in Sài Gòn, from late 1970 until 30/4/1975.
