= 10. A few stories from Hà Nội in the early days of the nationwide resistance

To mark fifty years since the start of the Toàn quốc Kháng chiến against the French colonialists’ second invasion of our country—
signaled by the opening shots in the Thủ đô and Hồ Chủ tịch’s immortal Call to Arms—
I think there is no need to say anything more about politics.
By now, we have enough documents of the Đảng and Nhà nước
to study that great resistance,
whose conclusion shook the world.
As for literature, although we still do not have a novel
worthy of the scale of that sacred war,
no one would dare claim
that such a work could be written in a mere fifteen minutes.
So I will simply recount a few small memories
of how one person,
just in his early twenties at the time,
took part in the preparations
and stepped into that long resistance.



After the South had begun its resistance on 23 September 1945,
even though our side showed goodwill, as Bác Hồ wrote:

“We want peace, we must make concessions.
But the more we concede,
the more the French colonialists press forward,
for they are determined to seize our country once again!”

In the North,
they had already captured the town of Lạng Sơn.
After the French stirred up trouble in Hải Phòng,
a tense, warlike atmosphere
settled over Hà Nội.
At that time, I was working in the Sở Công an Bắc Bộ.
I had just begun learning to drive a car
so I could use it when needed for work.
In mid-December 1946,
one night well past midnight,
I was asleep when Hoàng Mỹ—
Phó Giám đốc Sở Công an,
who lived in the same house—
shook me awake.
He told me to get dressed immediately;
there was urgent work.
We went down to the yard and over to the Sở.
Two cars were already there.
Our comrades were loading files onto the vehicles.
These were the files we used every day;
they had to be taken to a backup location.
Hoàng Mỹ had long been a skilled driver.
He said, “I’ll drive one car, you drive the other.”
I replied, “I’ve only just started learning.
I’m not sure I can handle driving at night.”
He answered,
“The backup place is confidential,
so we can’t let just anyone drive.
And you’ll be working there too.”
So off we went.
His car went first; mine followed behind.
At Ngã Tư Sở, my engine suddenly died.
After checking for some time,
Hoàng Mỹ concluded
that my battery had run out of power.
We still had to go on,
so he came up with this solution:
“You sit in the front car. I’ll drive the one behind.
The rear car will push the front one.
Your car has no lights,
but just steer by the light of my headlights behind you
and follow the road.”
We continued along đường Láng.
Our backup site was a Frenchman’s house in the suburbs
(the owner of the paper mill at that time,
about halfway down đường Láng).
We had barely arrived,
when Ngô Ngọc Du also turned up.
(He was then Phó Bí thư Thành ủy Hà Nội
and Bí thư Ngoại thành;
later he became Thứ trưởng Bộ Công an.)
He said,
“I just managed to jump into the roadside in time.
Otherwise I’d have been killed outright
by some car with no lights
that suddenly came up from behind
and shot past me.”
Hoàng Mỹ and I looked at each other.
Then Hoàng Mỹ said,
“That was our car.
It broke down at Ngã Tư Sở,
but we still had to get these files here.”
Truly, anh Du must have had blessings from seventy generations.
As for me, it gave me quite a fright.
All we could do
was laugh together.



When the French Foreign Legion
massacred our compatriots on Yên Ninh Street
on 17 December 1946,
right in the Thủ đô,
the atmosphere of war
completely enveloped Hà Nội.
Our Party cell’s last meeting
inside the city
was held on the night of 18 December 1946
at the trụ sở Công an quận Hàng Trống
(now quận Hoàn Kiếm).
Tasks were assigned to each person.
During the meeting,
the sound of French army trucks on the street outside
made the air both tense and solemn.
We did not know
that this would be our last meeting
with comrade Mạnh,
Đội trưởng trinh sát đặc biệt of Nha Công an
—a gentle yet resourceful man—
who had contributed so much
to trinh sát work in 1945 and 1946.



Only a few days after the night of 19 December 1946,
our Liên khu phố I
was surrounded by the enemy.
Despite the danger,
it was still possible to enter and leave Liên khu phố I.
The liaison path ran along a sandbank,
and at one point we had to crawl under the Long Biên Bridge,
even though enemy guards were posted above
to protect the bridge.
More than once,
the enemy discovered our people
and shot them.
Some of the dead
were buried by the enemy
head-down in the sand,
like planting an upside-down banana tree
on the path across the bank.
Near Tết,
Trần Quốc Hoàn (then a phái viên of the Trung ương
assigned to Khu ủy XI)
and Lê Quang Đạo (then Phó Bí thư Khu ủy XI)
went in to visit Liên khu phố I.
On their way out,
comrades in Liên khu I
gave Đạo an alarm clock as a keepsake.
As they crawled under Long Biên Bridge
with the giao liên team,
everyone had to go on their bellies.
The alarm clock couldn’t be kept in a pocket;
it had to be held in the hand
while crawling on elbows.
For some reason,
right then the clock started ringing—
“reng, reng”.
Everyone’s heart nearly stopped.
It was funny too,
but no one dared laugh.
Fortunately,
the guards overhead
did not hear it.
Back at base,
Hoàn told us the story
and challenged us to imagine
the look on Đạo’s face
as he played his part
in that tragic little comedy.



Suspicion of Việt gian
was widespread from the very first days
of the Toàn quốc Kháng chiến against the French.
Around Hà Nội,
many women were arrested on suspicion
of being Việt gian.
After an air raid,
if dân quân found a small mirror in a woman’s pocket,
she could be accused
of using it to signal planes.
Or if the trim on her trouser legs
had colors like the French tricolor,
she could be suspected too.
Only later was it concluded
that our women simply liked to keep up appearances,
and always carried a small mirror to check themselves.
As for the colored borders on the cloth,
they came from foreign-made black fabric used for trousers;
tailors simply used the edge of the fabric as-is
rather than hemming it.



Then there was the story of the “tắc bọp” gun.
People passed rumors
that the French had given Việt gian
special “tắc bọp” guns
to fire signal shots for their planes.
But no one had ever actually caught
a single “tắc bọp” gun
to see what it looked like.
At that time we were stationed
near pháo đài Láng.
There, on the night of 19 December 1946,
one of our artillery units
opened fire on the “Xi-ta-đen”
(the French name for the old Thành,
where French troops were stationed
under the 6 March 1946 Agreement).
That same night,
a cảm tử team of ours
was assigned to infiltrate Gia Lâm airfield
and destroy the enemy’s planes.
In reality,
the man tasked with bringing signal flares to Gia Lâm
left too late.
By the time shooting started,
the bridge was under curfew
and he could no longer cross.
The cảm tử team at Gia Lâm,
hearing the gunfire,
went ahead and infiltrated the airfield anyway.
The battle did not succeed as hoped.
Without any flares,
they could not signal the results to the Bộ chỉ huy.
Yet newspaper Thủ Đô,
following the original plan,
reported that we had destroyed
a number of enemy planes at Gia Lâm.
Everyone was delighted,
certain that the enemy
would not be able to fly planes quickly from Sài Gòn
to bomb and strafe the North.
Then, near noon on 20 December 1946,
we heard the sound of engines.
Several enemy planes
came and attacked pháo đài Láng,
catching everyone by surprise.
After dropping bombs,
they raked the area with machine-gun fire.
There were many “tắc bọp” sounds.
Surely there must be Việt gian nearby!
Some pháo đài Láng fighters
rushed off in the direction of the “tắc bọp” noises
to arrest whoever was signaling.
They burst into a shelter
and found only the pháo đài’s commanding officer
sitting there,
taking cover from the planes.
No one knew what to make of it.
Much later we learned
that the enemy used dum-dum rounds.
At the time,
we did not know this
and thought the sounds came from guns fired on the ground,
so people spoke of Việt gian firing “tắc bọp” guns.
If that day it had not been the pháo đài’s own commander
but an ordinary civilian,
it would have been hard for him
to escape being branded
a Việt gian firing “tắc bọp” signals for the French.



Once the fighting began,
everywhere Dân quân and Tự vệ
(whom the French called Việt Minh carré
because their side caps had a square star)
and the Vệ quốc đoàn
set up checkpoints and guard posts.
Going out at night
and running into a checkpoint
manned by Vệ quốc đoàn
was the most unnerving.
They liked to stand hidden in the dark,
spotting you from far away,
but letting you come close
before cocking their rifles with a loud “rốp”
and shouting:
“Who’s there? Stop. Hands up!”
It could startle you badly.
If a gun went off by accident,
the consequences were obvious.
There were also checkpoints
staffed by female dân quân.
Some would shout:
“Who’s there? Stop. Hands up. Turn around.
No… I’ll shoot now!”
So men passing such checkpoints
often tried to tease them.
Someone must have taught the women
how to get their own back.
One cold, rainy night,
a man passed through a checkpoint
staffed by female dân quân
who recognized him
as someone who liked to make mischief.
He heard:
“Who’s there? Stop. Hands up. Turn around.
Lie down. No, I’ll shoot now!”
He had no choice
but to do exactly as ordered.
Back at his unit,
cold as it was,
he took a bath immediately
so he’d have an excuse to wash his clothes,
then went straight to bed
and kept silent.
Unfortunately, someone learned of the story
and spread it around.
From then on,
young men began to “keep their distance”
from those “lady dân quân”.



In the early days of the Toàn quốc Kháng chiến in Hà Nội,
the Ủy ban Kháng chiến khu XI
issued a Thẻ bài Hỏa tốc
for people on urgent business.
Presenting this card
allowed one to pass checkpoints quickly.
At that time,
Vương Thừa Vũ was Quân khu trưởng khu XI.
At some point he either lost
or misplaced his own Thẻ bài Hỏa tốc,
which bore his name and title clearly.
Fearing villains might get hold of it and abuse it,
he signed a general notice
that anyone found carrying a Thẻ bài Hỏa tốc
bearing the name Vương Thừa Vũ
was to be detained
and reported immediately.
He considered that sufficient caution
and felt reassured.
One night, returning from duty
through a village outside the city,
he, too, obediently presented his Thẻ bài Hỏa tốc.
After examining it by storm-lamp,
the dân quân shouted:
“Comrades, we’ve caught Vương Thừa Vũ!”
He thought to himself,
“So soon after fighting has begun,
has the countryside already filled with Việt gian?”
Hot-tempered by nature,
he ordered the guards with him
to arrest the dân quân at the checkpoint
and interrogate them at once.
It turned out
that after losing his original card,
he had a new one made
with the same name,
Vương Thừa Vũ.
The checkpoint had also received the notice
about the missing Thẻ bài.
They were simply following instructions—
and had caught the real Vương Thừa Vũ.
So there was the story
of Vương Thừa Vũ
signing an order
that led to his own “arrest”.



Vương Thừa Vũ was famous for his temper.
He once smashed several telephones
because the line kept cutting in and out.
Among the main regiments fighting in khu XI
was one led by Phùng Thế Tài.
He was a good man,
but no less hot-tempered than Vương Thừa Vũ.
Back then, even before ranks were formally introduced,
he already had the nickname
“quan năm đòn gánh”.
Once, the people caught a Vệ quốc soldier
“involved” with a village girl in a haystack.
The command considered it a rape case
and decided to convene a field court-martial
to sentence him to death as a warning.
Vương Thừa Vũ appointed Phùng Thế Tài
to preside over the court
in the area of Tây Mỗ and Đại Mỗ.
When the trial ended,
Phùng Thế Tài returned
and over dinner told Vương Thừa Vũ
that he had acquitted the accused.
Vũ did not understand why.
Tài, meanwhile,
could hardly speak for laughing.
What had happened was this:
The Vệ quốc soldier admitted to moral misconduct,
and so was facing the expected severe sentence.
But before the “death sentence” was pronounced,
the presiding judge asked the “victim”
if she had anything to say.
After a long hesitation,
she stammered:
“Em… em… cũng xin… ủng hộ một tý ạ.”
(“I… I… would also like… to support him a little.”)
The whole audience burst into laughter.
And Phùng Thế Tài himself
could no longer keep a straight face.
In khu XI,
the phrase “ủng hộ một tý!”
became a well-known anecdote.



On the night of 19 December 1946,
we were near pháo đài Láng.
Hearing our artillery fire
into the Thành where French troops were garrisoned,
we cheered with joy.
After the French captured Ngã Tư Sở,
we withdrew to Mễ Trì,
then to Đại Mỗ and Tây Mỗ.
While Liên khu I
was still encircled by the enemy,
Hoàng Mỹ—Giám đốc Công an khu XI—
assigned me and Lê Tuấn (also called Thuần)
to open a training course
for Công an khu XI
to prepare them for wartime work.
We borrowed the đình of La Dương village
(one of the “three La” villages)
as our classroom.
The course lasted about a month.
At night we slept on straw in villagers’ homes.
Going into the resistance,
each of us had only two sets of clothes;
Lê Tuấn brought along one red flag with a yellow star.
On cold nights,
with nothing else to cover ourselves,
we had to pull the flag over us.
(Nowadays, at funerals,
only leading cadres have their coffins covered with the flag.)
We divided the teaching between us.
Tuấn, coming from the main-force army,
taught military subjects.
I lectured on investigation,
building networks, secret work, and so on.
The students came from all backgrounds:
Công an cadres working in city districts;
young street vendors selling newspapers and breakfast food;
shoe-shiners, hat-cleaners;
and some of the urban poor
who had gone into the resistance along with the mass organizations—
those who had worked as live-in helpers,
water carriers, and the like.
They joined the resistance naturally and voluntarily.
I will never forget
the closing day of the course.
We all shared a very plain meal
that many of us still remember
when we meet again today.
The celebration was entirely home-made performances.
Most memorable were the items
from the newspaper sellers, breakfast vendors,
shoe-shiners and hat-cleaners of Hà Nội.
Anyone who lived in Hà Nội then
remembers the morning street cries
that were part of the city’s character.
Without anyone on stage,
the audience—who were all from Hà Nội—
suddenly heard calls of “Báo! Báo, ơ…”
Some people quietly wiped their eyes.
Then came “Bài hát Người Hà Nội” by Nguyễn Đình Thi,
which the youngsters had learned
who knows when.
It stirred up even more strongly
the image of the resisting Thủ đô.
From that course
came the first Công an cadres
assigned to build networks in areas under enemy control,
including inner Hà Nội,
immediately after Trung đoàn Thủ đô
withdrew from the city.
Chung from quận IV,
entering the Thành with a “returnee” family cover,
was appointed Trưởng khu (chef d’ilôt)
around today’s Hàng Cót.
This group was later exposed;
both Chung and Minh were imprisoned
and sent to Côn Đảo
until they were exchanged back in 1954.
Many of the youngsters at that time
later became giao liên;
some grew and advanced to become cadres and Party members
of Công an Hà Nội throughout the resistance.
Not a few went through prison and exile.
Even now, some have already retired.



One of the early achievements
of our trinh sát teams
came from a group that entered
enemy-occupied outer districts of quận IV.
They brought back to the leadership
a military map and a compass
taken from an enemy unit.
The price for that success
was that chị M.
was raped by African colonial troops.
I was deeply moved and distressed
when I heard their report in person.
Throughout the resistance,
there were many such shining examples
of Công an Hà Nội cadres and fighters
who deserve to be remembered and honored,
far more than can be recounted here.



As for myself and my friends of that generation,
that is how we entered
the nine-year resistance.
Even now, whenever I think back,
I cannot help but feel affection and sorrow
for the men and women of Công an Hà Nội,
many of whom remain nameless,
who contributed to victory in the resistance
through their own great sacrifices,
without ever demanding reward or recognition.
Hà Nội, 19 December 1996
