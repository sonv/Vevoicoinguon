= 2. A request to eat fish

Speaking of Sài Gòn, my mother
often recalled one story.

In 1936 our family was
living in Nam Định.
My father was teaching at
Cửa Bắc School (Jules Ferry),
and also writing.
His book _Kép Tư Bền_ had
sparked a lively literary debate
at the time.

When the school had a
three-month summer vacation,
friends in the South
invited him to visit.
My father made a trip through
the provinces of Central and
Southern Vietnam.
Wherever he went, he sent
letters or photographs home.

Passing through Huế, he had to
set aside nearly half a day
to sign his books as keepsakes
for readers there.

After visiting many provinces
in Cochinchina#footnote[Name used under French colonial administration for southern Vietnam.] (as it was then called),
my father went over to Cambodia--then called “Cao Miên”-- to see an old friend,
Đào Trọng Đủ.
In his letters home from that leg
of the trip, he wrote that after
touring the palaces of Angkor,
he went on an excursion to
Koh Kong#footnote[Cambodian island that used to belong to Thailand.], a small island
on the border of
Cambodia and Siam.
He also wrote ahead to say he
would return to Nam Định by the
express train from Saigon.


One day, the “wire-house”#footnote[Old Vietnamese phrase for the Post & Telegraph office.]
delivered a telegram from my father:
It gave the exact date he would arrive
back in Nam Định, and—most unusually—
asked my mother to have fish ready
for him the day he returned.

My mother couldn’t make sense of it.
Had he gone so long without eating fish
that he had to telegraph about it?
Or was some friend from the South
coming back with him who especially
liked fish?

Still, knowing my father loved
_Canh nấu dấm_#footnote[_Canh cá nấu dấm_: a Vietnamese fish soup with vinegar or souring agents.],
she went to Rồng Market in front
of our house, bought a big fish,
fried part of it, and with the rest
made a delicious pot of sour soup.

By noon, my father knocked at the door.
Before he even put down his luggage
or washed his face, he asked:
“Where’s the fish?”

My mother was puzzled—no friends
had come home with him.
“What fish dish is this for?” she asked.

My father held out his hand.
In it was a small bamboo cage,
and inside, an adorable kitten.

“For this Siamese cat!” he said.
“A genuine Siamese.#footnote[_Mèo Xiêm_: Siamese cat breed, historically associated with Siam (Thailand).]
It was brought back from Koh Kong!”

The whole family burst out laughing,
delighted by my father’s playful,
mischievous streak.
