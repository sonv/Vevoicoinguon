= 25. When we heard the tracks of American tanks rumbling overhead

In 1965, the United States landed troops in the South, turning their “special war” into a large-scale ground war.
The base of Khu Sài Gòn – Gia Định (commonly called T4) was located in the ten liberated communes of northern Củ Chi district.
From the moment the Americans deployed their own forces, aside from major sweeps involving several divisions and brigades into Củ Chi (within T4) and Bến Cát (in Bình Dương Province — today Sông Bé), which they called the “Iron Triangle,” they also conducted brigade-level sweeps into Củ Chi at least once a month.

In 1967, the Khu ủy T4 convened, but because the base was no longer safe, the Trung ương Cục instructed us to travel to their headquarters for the meeting.
At that meeting, anh Nguyễn Văn Vịnh, envoy of the Bộ Chính trị from Hà Nội, attended and conveyed the policy for the Tổng tấn công planned for early Mậu Thân 1968.
I wrote a separate report on that matter for the historical agencies, so here I only recount one memory.

After the Khu ủy meeting, I returned to Củ Chi.
My unit was stationed in ấp Phú Hiệp, Phú Mỹ Hưng Commune, near ấp Dược, beside the Sài Gòn River.
My task was to disseminate the policy and prepare for the Mậu Thân operations within the area assigned to me.

As soon as I arrived, the enemy launched a sweep.
As usual, a brigade-level sweep would end within a few days.
We stayed in place, ready to cling to the tunnels if necessary.
I also sent word calling the An ninh cadres from inner Sài Gòn out to Củ Chi to discuss work.

For some reason, this time the enemy used fewer troops but swept far longer.
Over a week passed and they had not withdrawn.
Scouts reported: the Americans were sweeping from Bùng Binh (Trảng Bàng) toward ấp Dược, where we were.
Wherever they advanced, their tanks bulldozed down the trees; at night they regrouped; the next morning they continued.
Before the tanks pushed forward, B-52s carpet-bombed the area; sitting in the bunker, avoiding shrapnel, the earth swayed like a hammock.

On the day the sweep approached ấp Dược, anh Hai Yên, Chief of An ninh Quận 4 (inner city), arrived in Củ Chi following my summons.
The giao liên had to cross countless ambush points to bring him safely to me.

At dawn the next morning, enemy artillery barrages struck directly onto our location.
As soon as the shelling ceased, helicopters air-assaulted American troops into the area.
Our protection team and the village guerrillas had to fight the American infantry at distances of only five or ten meters.
Eventually they withdrew into the tunnels.

Inside the tunnels, taking advantage of the time, I informed anh Hai Yên of the Bộ Chính trị’s assessment and the policy for the Tổng tấn công planned for early 1968.
At that time we still used the concept “Tổng công kích, Tổng khởi nghĩa.”
We worked in complete darkness — no candles in the tunnels — I spoke from memory, and anh Hai Yên absorbed every word.

Above us, on the surface, directly over the section of tunnel where we sat, we heard the clattering tracks of American tanks and armored vehicles — roong roỏng.

Near noon, scouts reported that American troops suspected some civilian graves were tunnel entrances; they were blasting them with explosives.
Explosions boomed overhead.
Then the enemy discovered a camouflaged entrance to an anti-artillery shelter — the spot where I normally worked each day; from there a hidden passage led down into the tunnels.
American troops were now concentrating their explosive charges at that very place.

The tunnel segment connecting our location to the guerrilla section had already collapsed under the weight of a passing American tank.
Although the enemy had not discovered the tunnel, they had cut us off from the village guerrillas.
We buried our documents deep inside the tunnel, preparing to fight if the enemy broke in.

Looking at my watch, it was past noon.
Time felt strangely stretched.

By around five in the afternoon, the rumbling tank tracks grew quiet.
We assessed that they had regrouped, just like on previous days.
As usual, the heavy-lift helicopter would arrive carrying bathwater for the American troops (brought from the Philippines, because they claimed Sài Gòn water was not clean enough), then deliver prostitutes in bright blue and red dresses; and the next morning would return to retrieve everything before the sweep continued.

Scouts confirmed they had indeed regrouped.
We waited until dusk, then emerged one by one to relocate toward Hố Bò, which had not yet been swept.

The area where we had been stationed — normally thick with vegetation — was now completely bare, an empty plain.
No one could recognize the familiar place unless they had just climbed up from the tunnel beneath it.

A few days later, when the enemy swept into Hố Bò, we had to withdraw temporarily to Sa Nhỏ, a hamlet where people lived openly under the enemy, though not legally in their eyes.

There, a startling sight greeted us.
In earlier years, Củ Chi’s forests were so dense one could not see more than a few hundred meters.
Now from Sa Nhỏ we could see the communes of southern Bến Cát on the far side of the Sài Gòn River — nearly ten kilometers as the crow flies.
Not a single tree stood upright.

Even so, every day, American “cá rô” helicopters (small jet-type craft) flew low patrols, dipping their noses to blow aside clumps of grass to check for anyone hiding.
The slightest suspicion brought volleys of artillery.

We arranged for anh Hai Yên to return to the inner city.

On the night of the Mậu Thân offensive, I met him again in Quận 4.
It was anh Hai Yên who personally eliminated enemy agents in one neighborhood and rallied the people to rise up there.

In later years, when the South was fully liberated and the country reunited, whenever we met, anh Hai Yên would recall how he and I sat together in the tunnels, discussing the Tổng công kích, Tổng khởi nghĩa in Sài Gòn, while the tracks of American tanks clattered overhead.
He joked: “Only Communists, in moments like that, could still hold faith and revolutionary optimism.”

$ * * * $

Now, anh Hai Yên has retired to his hometown in Xuân Đỉnh, Từ Liêm, Hà Nội.
His real name is Dung, formerly a Colonel in the Công an.
Unfortunately, he has suffered a stroke, sometimes with paralysis on one side, and still has difficulty walking.

This Tết, when I visited him, he happily recalled again the time when the two of us heard the tracks of American tanks rumbling above our heads …
