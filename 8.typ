= 8. The birth of the newspaper Công An Mới#footnote[Công An Mới: New Public Security]

Before the August Revolution of 1945,
the Party had already established the Đoàn Cảnh sát cứu quốc,
with Nguyễn Ngô Học, Thịnh, Ấp, and others in its Executive Committee.

In 1946, after the decree merging Liêm phóng and Cảnh sát
into Việt Nam Công an Vụ,
and the creation of Nha Công an Trung ương,
the Đoàn Cảnh sát cứu quốc was expanded
into the Đoàn Công an cứu quốc.
At that time, I was the Party cell secretary,
and at the congress of the Đoàn Công an cứu quốc,
my colleagues elected me Secretary of the Đoàn.

After the August Revolution of 1945,
because the new Press Decree made it easy to publish newspapers,
we in the Executive Committee discussed creating a newspaper of the Đoàn,
to be called newspaper Công An Mới.
We considered it the newspaper of the Đoàn,
not of Ngành.

In those days, because the Party had gone underground,
the Central Committee instructed that agency leaders —
even though they were Party members —
should not attend Party cell meetings,
but instead take part in Đảng đoàn meetings.
The Party cell secretary also
was allowed to attend these as well.

In one Đảng đoàn meeting,
I reported the plan to publish the newspaper of the Đoàn Công an cứu quốc.
The permit for newspaper Công an mới
had already been issued by the Sở Kiểm duyệt Bắc Bộ,
with me as the responsible signatory in my role as Secretary of the Đoàn Công an cứu quốc.

Hearing this, Lê Giản asked me about its content,
its writers, its management —
how everything would be arranged.
To be honest, I had little experience,
apart from having helped with the newspaper Nước Nam Mới
in the Tân Trào base under the direction of anh Văn.

In the end, Lê Giản concluded
that although the permit had been granted,
the Đoàn did not have the capacity to run the newspaper.
It would be better for Nha Công an Trung ương to take on the task.
Thus, the newspaper Công an mới was still published,
but under the management of the Nha Công an,
and became the official newspaper of Ngành, distributed widely.

Several issues came out in 1946.
Then the nationwide resistance war against the French began,
and newspaper Công an mới ceased publication.
During the resistance years,
Nha Công an published only an internal bulletin,
called Rèn Luyện.

Therefore, it can be said
that newspaper Công an mới
was the forerunner of today’s newspaper Công an nhân dân
—not the internal bulletin Rèn Luyện.

For that reason,
newspaper Công an nhân dân today
is only fifty years old.
